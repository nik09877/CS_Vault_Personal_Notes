# Problems I Faced
- First time trying to use Typescript in React+Bootstrap and using Spring Boot + MySQL
- I chose SQL for its ACID property and able to handle concurrent updates and to learn how to integrate MySQL with Spring Boot
- I used a lot of `!important` in `css` files because I am using Bootstrap and I don't want my styles to be over written.
