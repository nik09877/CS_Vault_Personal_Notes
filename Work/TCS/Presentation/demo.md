<!-- slide template="[[tpl-footer]]" -->
# This header will be part of the content section defined in the template

Everything define outside a block will be placed in the content section.
Therefore every template has to contain at least a content variable.

To place a text into the footer section you have to create a block comment with the name of the variable you defined in the template.
