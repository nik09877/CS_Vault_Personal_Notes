# Database Indexing
- How DBMS determines in which Data Page too store the row, if we have done indexing on a column ?
	- First it inserts the key into B+ tree, then it checks the neighbouring key, to which Data Page it is pointing to, if that Data Page is free it will insert the Row into that Data Page
	- Else DBMS does page splitting, it splits the Data Page into two and inserts equally into both of those pages.
- The way the rows are inserted, they are stored in that order in Data Pages. So if we create index on a column, the keys point to the Data Pages in which they are present, so we need a way to sort the Rows stored in Data Pages, that's why we need the Offset array
- Non-clustered indexing is made on secondary keys, composite keys, we can have many non-clustered index
- Dis adv
	- B+ trees need huge memory
	- B+ trees are stored in index pages, index pages are stored in Data blocks, so we need to manage the index page mapping to Data blocks also
- How searching happens
	- Load index pages that hold the B+ tree
	- search the key
	- find the data page
	- load the data block in memory
	- then search in that
