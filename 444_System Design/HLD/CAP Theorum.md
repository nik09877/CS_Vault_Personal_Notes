# CAP Theorum

- Defines desirable properties of distributed systems with replicated data.
	- Consistency
		- Data is consistent / same across all the DB nodes
	- Availability
		- All the DB nodes should respond
	- Partition Tolerance
		- System is up, even if the connection between any 2 DB nodes fails
- All 3 can't be used at once
- CA and CP, AP are possible, CAP is not possible
- In CA if Partition happens the system will be down 
- In CP if Partition happens we have to turn off a node
- In AP consistency can not be achieved
- Never trade off Partition tolerance in real world
