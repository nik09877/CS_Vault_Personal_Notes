# Approaches
# Problem Solving with Design Patterns ## Car Rental System - **Design Patterns**: - **Factory Method**: Use it to create different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, SUVs) based on user preferences. - **Decorator**: Apply it to add optional features or accessories to rental vehicles dynamically. - **Approach**: - Use Factory Method to create instances of vehicles based on user requests. - Apply Decorator to add features like GPS, child seats, or insurance to the selected vehicle. ## Online Hotel Booking System - **Design Patterns**: - **Observer**: Implement it to notify users of room availability and price changes. - **State**: Use it to manage the booking process (e.g., booking, payment, confirmation). - **Approach**: - Apply Observer to notify users of available rooms and special offers. - Utilize State to model the different states of a booking, from reservation to confirmation. ## Car Booking Service like Ola, Uber - **Design Patterns**: - **Strategy**: Use it to define various transportation strategies (e.g., car, bike, shared) and switch between them. - **Observer**: Implement it for tracking the location of drivers and notifying users. - **Approach**: - Apply Strategy to handle different types of transportation services. - Use Observer to track driver locations and provide real-time updates to users. ## Food Delivery App like Swiggy and Zomato - **Design Patterns**: - **Observer**: Use it to track the order status and notify users. - **Decorator**: Apply it to customize food orders with optional items (e.g., extra cheese, toppings). - **Approach**: - Implement Observer to keep users informed about the status of their food orders. - Use Decorator to allow users to customize their food orders with extra options. ## BookMyShow & Concurrency Handling - **Design Patterns**: - **Singleton**: Use it to ensure a single instance of a booking system to prevent overbooking. - **Observer**: Implement it to notify users of ticket availability and show updates. - **Approach**: - Apply Singleton to create a single booking system instance. - Use Observer to notify users of available seats and showtime changes. ## IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) - **Design Patterns**: - **State**: Use it to manage the booking process (e.g., checking availability, reservation, payment). - **Observer**: Implement it to notify users of train availability and booking updates. - **Approach**: - Apply State to model different stages of the booking process. - Use Observer to notify users of train availability and booking status.
