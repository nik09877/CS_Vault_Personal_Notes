# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- OOP is a programming paradigm in which the the programs consists of classes and objects.
### Classes
- A class is a user defined data type which acts as a blueprint for making objects.
- All code that you write in Java is inside a class.
- **Encapsulation** is simply combining data and methods in one package and hiding the implementation details from the users of the object.
- The bits of data in an object are called its ***instance fields***, and the procedures that operate on the data are called its ***methods***.
- The key to making encapsulation work is to have methods *never directly access instance fields in a class other than their own.*
- Java, in fact, comes with a “cosmic superclass” called `Object`. All other classes extend this class.
- The concept of extending a class to obtain another class is called **inheritance**.
- When you extend an existing class, the new class has all the properties and methods of the class that you extend.
### Objects
- Objects are the instances of a class.
- It has three key characteristics:
	1. It's behaviour
	2. It's state
	3. It's Identity

### Identifying classes
- A simple rule of thumb in identifying classes is to look for **nouns** in the problem analysis.
- Methods, on the other hand, correspond to **verbs**.
### Relationship between classes
- The most common relationships between classes are:
	1. Dependence ("uses-a")
	2. Aggregation ("has-a")
	3. Inheritance ("is-a")
- The dependence, or “uses–a” relationship, is the most obvious and also the most general.
	- For example, the `Order` class uses the `Account` class because `Order` objects need to access `Account` objects to check for credit status. But the `Item` class does not depend on the `Account` class, because `Item` objects never need to worry about customer accounts.
	- Thus, a class depends on another class if its methods use or manipulate objects of that class.
	- Try to minimize the number of classes that depend on each other ("Coupling").
- The aggregation, or “has–a” relationship, is easy to understand because it is concrete.
	- For example, an `Order` object contains `Item` objects. Containment means that objects of class A contain objects of class B.
- The inheritance, or “is–a” relationship, expresses a relationship between a more special and a more general class.

- You draw classes as rectangles, and relationships as arrows with various adornments.

# Using Predefined Classes

### Objects and Object variables
- you use **constructors** to construct new instances.
- Constructors always have the same name as the class name.
- There is an important difference between objects and object variables. For example:
```Java
Date deadline; // deadline doesn't refer to any object
```
- It defines an object variable, deadline, that can refer to objects of type Date. It is important to realize that the variable deadline is not an object and, in fact, does not even refer to an object yet. You cannot use any Date methods on this variable at this time.
- An object variable doesn’t actually contain an object. It acts as a reference to an object.
- You can explicitly set an object variable to `null` to indicate that it currently refers to no object.
- If you apply a method to a `null` value, a `NullPointerException` occurs.

### LocalDate Class of Java Library
- When you use the `Date` class, the time is represented by the number of milliseconds (positive or negative) from a fixed point, the so-called epoch, which is 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. UTC is the Coordinated Universal Time, the scientific time standard which is, for practical purposes, the same as the more familiar GMT, or Greenwich Mean Time.

# Defining Your Own Classes
- To build a complete program, you combine several classes, one of which has a main method.
Program:

### Use of Multiple Source Files
- Many programmers prefer to each class into its own source file.
- When the Java compiler sees the `Employee` class being used inside `EmployeeTest.java`, it will look for a file named `Employee.class`. 
- If it does not find that file, it automatically searches for` Employee.java` and compiles it. 
- Moreover, if the timestamp of the version of `Employee.java` is newer than that of the existing `Employee.class` file, the Java compiler will automatically recompile the file.
### Constructors
- The constructor runs when you construct objects of the class.
- A constructor has the same name as the class.
- A class can have more than one constructor.
- A constructor can take zero, one, or more parameters.
- A constructor has no return value.
- A constructor is always called with the new operator.
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804220622.png)
### Implicit and Explicit Parameters
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804221112.png)
- The implicit parameter is the object that calls the method.
- Some people call the implicit parameter the target or receiver of the method call.
- In every method, the keyword `this` refers to the implicit parameter.
- The number inside the parentheses after the method name, is an explicit parameter.
Note:

### How to implement Encapsulation?
- you need to supply three items:
	- A private data field;
	- A public field accessor method;
	- A public field mutator method.
Note:
![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804221542.png)

### Class-Based Access Privileges
- You know that a method can access the private data of the object on which it is invoked.
- But a method can access the private data of all objects of its class.
- For example, consider a method equals that compares two employees:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804221808.png)

### Final Instance Fields
- `Final` field must be initialized when the object is constructed.
	- That is, you must guarantee that the field value has been set **after the end of every constructor**.
- The final modifier is particularly useful for fields whose type is **primitive** or an **immutable class**. (A class is immutable if none of its methods ever mutate its objects. For example, the String class is immutable.)
- For mutable classes, the final modifier can be confusing. For example, consider a field
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804224021.png)

# Static Fields and Methods
### Static Fields
- If you define a field as `static`, then there is only one such field per class.
### Static Constants
- Static variables are quite rare. However, static constants are more common.
- For example, the Math class defines a static constant:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804224259.png)
### Static Methods
- Static methods are methods that do not operate on objects and belong to the class.
- Static methods don't have a `this` parameter.
- A static method can only access a static field not instance fields.
- To call a static method use `className.staticMethodName()`
- Use static methods in two situations:
	- When a method doesn’t need to access the object state because all needed parameters are supplied as explicit parameters (example: `Math.pow`).
	- When a method only needs to access static fields of the class.
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804224655.png)

### The Main Method
- Every class can have a main method. That is a handy trick for unit testing of classes.
- For example, you can add a main method to the Employee class:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804225001.png)

# Method Parameters
- The Java programming language always uses **call by value**.
- There are, however, two kinds of method parameters: 
	- Primitive types (numbers, boolean values) 
	- Object references
- In case of object references, the method gets a copy of the object reference and both the original and the copy refer to the same object.
- A method cannot modify a parameter of a primitive type (that is, numbers or boolean values).
- A method can change the state of an object parameter.
- A method cannot make an object parameter refer to a new object.

### Note:
- Some programmers (and unfortunately even some book authors) claim that Java uses call by reference for objects. That is false. As this is such a common misunderstanding, it is worth examining a counterexample in detail.
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804225451.png)

# Object Construction
- **Overloading** occurs if several methods have the same name, but different parameters.
- You cannot have two methods with the same names and parameter types but different return types.
### Default Field Initialization
- If you don’t set a field explicitly in a constructor, it is automatically set to a default value: numbers to `0`, boolean values to `false`, and object references to `null`.
- But you must always explicitly initialize local variables in a method.
- If a class supplies at least one constructor but does not supply a no-argument constructor, it is illegal to construct objects without supplying arguments.
### Explicit Field Initialization
- There are many ways to initialize the instance fields of a Class.
- You can simply assign a value to any field in the class definition. For example:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804234455.png)
- This assignment is carried out before the constructor executes.
- The initialization value doesn’t have to be a constant value.
- Here is an example:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804234619.png)
### Calling Another Constructor
- The keyword this refers to the implicit parameter of a method.
- If the first statement of a constructor has the form `this(. . .)`, then the constructor calls another constructor of the same class.
- Here is a typical example:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804234859.png)

### Initialization Blocks
- You have already seen two ways to initialize a data field:
	- By setting a value in a constructor
	- By assigning a value in the declaration
- There is a third mechanism in Java, called an **initialization block**.
- Class declarations can contain arbitrary blocks of code. These blocks are executed whenever an object of that class is constructed.
- For example:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804235051.png)
- Here is what happens in detail when a constructor is called:
	1. If the first line of the constructor calls a second constructor, then the second constructor executes with the provided arguments.
	2. Otherwise,
		1. All data fields are initialized to their default values (0, false, or null).
		2. All field initializers and initialization blocks are executed, in the order in which they occur in the class declaration.
	3. The body of the constructor is executed.
- To initialize a static field, either supply an initial value or use a static initialization block.
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804235316.png)
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230804235331.png)
- Static initialization occurs when the class is first loaded. 
- Like instance fields, static fields are 0, false, or null unless you explicitly set them to another value. 
- All static field initializers and static initialization blocks are executed in the order in which they occur in the class declaration.

### Object Destruction and the finalize Method
- Since Java does automatic garbage collection, manual memory reclamation is not needed, so Java does not support destructors.
- Do not use the finalize method for cleanup. 
	- That method was intended to be called before the garbage collector sweeps away an object. However, you simply cannot know when this method will be called, and it is now deprecated.

# Packages
- You can group classes in a collection called a *package*.
- The main reason for using packages is to guarantee the uniqueness of class names.
- To absolutely guarantee a unique package name, use an Internet domain name (which is known to be unique) written in reverse. You then use sub-packages for different projects.
	- For example, consider the domain `horstmann.com`. When written in reverse order, it turns into the package name `com.horstmann`. You can then append a project name, such as `com.horstmann.corejava`. If you then place the `Employee` class into that package, the “fully qualified” name becomes c`om.horstmann.corejava.Employee`.
### Class Importation
- A class can use all classes from its own package and all public classes from other packages.
- You can access the public classes in another package in two ways.
	1. `packageName.className`
	2. using `import`
### Using Import
- You place `import` statements at the top of your source files (***but below any package statements***)
- You can import a specific class or the whole package.
- For example, you can import all classes in the `java.time` package with the statement `import java.time.*`
- You can also import a specific class inside a package: `import java.time.LocalDate`
- However, note that you can only use the * notation to **import a single package**. You cannot use `import java.*` or `import java.*.*` to import all packages with the java prefix.
- What if there you import 2 packages having same class name?
- Look at the Example below :
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230805000930.png)
- Locating classes in packages is an activity of the compiler. 
- The bytecodes in class files always use full package names to refer to other classes.

### Static Imports
- It is a form of the import statement that permits the importing of **static methods and fields**, not just classes.
- For example, if you add the directive:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230805001144.png)
- You can also import a specific method or field:
- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230805001232.png)

### Addition of a Class into a Package
- To place classes inside a package, put the name of the package at the top of your source file, before the code that defines the classes in the package.
- If you don’t put a package statement in the source file, then the classes in that source file belong to the ***unnamed package***.
- Place source files into a subdirectory that matches the full package name.
	- For example, all source files in the `com.horstmann.corejava` package should be in a subdirectory `com/horstmann/corejava`
	- ![](../../z_assets/Pasted_image_20230805001634.png)
- Class files can also be stored in a ***JAR (Java archive)*** file.
- A ***JAR*** file contains multiple class files and subdirectories in a compressed format, saving space and improving performance.
### Package Access
- Features tagged as public can be used by any class.
- Private features can be used only by the class that defines them.
- If you don’t specify either public or private, the feature (that is, the class, method, or variable) can be accessed by all methods in the same package.
# Jar Files (On Hold)
# Documentation Comments (On Hold)
# Class Design Hints
1. Always keep data private.
2. Always initialize data.
3. Break up classes that have too many responsibilities.
4. Make the names of your classes and methods reflect their responsibilities.
5. Prefer immutable classes.
	1. That is, no method can modify the state of an object, instead of mutating objects, methods should return new objects.
