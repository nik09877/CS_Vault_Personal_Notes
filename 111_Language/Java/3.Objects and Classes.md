# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- OOP is a programming paradigm in which the the programs consists of classes and objects.
### Classes
- A class is a user defined data type which acts as a blueprint for making objects.
- All code that you write in Java is inside a class.
- **Encapsulation** is simply combining data and methods in one package and hiding the implementation details from the users of the object.
- The bits of data in an object are called its ***instance fields***, and the procedures that operate on the data are called its ***methods***.
- The key to making encapsulation work is to have methods *never directly access instance fields in a class other than their own.*
- Java, in fact, comes with a “cosmic superclass” called `Object`. All other classes extend this class.
- The concept of extending a class to obtain another class is called **inheritance**.
- When you extend an existing class, the new class has all the properties and methods of the class that you extend.
### Objects
- Objects are the instances of a class.
- It has three key characteristics:
	1. It's behaviour
	2. It's state
	3. It's Identity

### Identifying classes
- A simple rule of thumb in identifying classes is to look for **nouns** in the problem analysis.
- Methods, on the other hand, correspond to **verbs**.
### Relationship between classes
- The most common relationships between classes are:
	1. Dependence ("uses-a")
	2. Aggregation ("has-a")
	3. Inheritance ("is-a")
- The dependence, or “uses–a” relationship, is the most obvious and also the most general.
	- For example, the `Order` class uses the `Account` class because `Order` objects need to access `Account` objects to check for credit status. But the `Item` class does not depend on the `Account` class, because `Item` objects never need to worry about customer accounts.
	- Thus, a class depends on another class if its methods use or manipulate objects of that class.
	- Try to minimize the number of classes that depend on each other ("Coupling").
- The aggregation, or “has–a” relationship, is easy to understand because it is concrete.
	- For example, an `Order` object contains `Item` objects. Containment means that objects of class A contain objects of class B.
- The inheritance, or “is–a” relationship, expresses a relationship between a more special and a more general class.

- You draw classes as rectangles, and relationships as arrows with various adornments.

# Using Predefined Classes

### Objects and Object variables
- you use **constructors** to construct new instances.
- Constructors always have the same name as the class name.
- There is an important difference between objects and object variables. For example:
```Java
Date deadline; // deadline doesn't refer to any object
```
- It defines an object variable, deadline, that can refer to objects of type Date. It is important to realize that the variable deadline is not an object and, in fact, does not even refer to an object yet. You cannot use any Date methods on this variable at this time.
- An object variable doesn’t actually contain an object. It acts as a reference to an object.
- You can explicitly set an object variable to `null` to indicate that it currently refers to no object.
- If you apply a method to a `null` value, a `NullPointerException` occurs.

### LocalDate Class of Java Library
- When you use the `Date` class, the time is represented by the number of milliseconds (positive or negative) from a fixed point, the so-called epoch, which is 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. UTC is the Coordinated Universal Time, the scientific time standard which is, for practical purposes, the same as the more familiar GMT, or Greenwich Mean Time.

# Defining Your Own Classes
- To build a complete program, you combine several classes, one of which has a main method.

### Use of Multiple Source Files
- Many programmers prefer to each class into its own source file.
- When the Java compiler sees the `Employee` class being used inside `EmployeeTest.java`, it will look for a file named `Employee.class`. 
- If it does not find that file, it automatically searches for` Employee.java` and compiles it. 
- Moreover, if the timestamp of the version of `Employee.java` is newer than that of the existing `Employee.class` file, the Java compiler will automatically recompile the file.
### Constructors
- The constructor runs when you construct objects of the class.
- A constructor has the same name as the class.
- A class can have more than one constructor.
- A constructor can take zero, one, or more parameters.
- A constructor has no return value.
- A constructor is always called with the new operator.

### Implicit and Explicit Parameters
- ![[Pasted image 20230804221112.png]]
- The implicit parameter is the object that calls the method.
- Some people call the implicit parameter the target or receiver of the method call.
- In every method, the keyword `this` refers to the implicit parameter.
- The number inside the parentheses after the method name, is an explicit parameter.

### How to implement Encapsulation?
- you need to supply three items:
	- A private data field;
	- A public field accessor method;
	- A public field mutator method.
