# Classes, Super classes and Sub classes
### Defining Subclasses
- Use the Java keyword `extends` to denote inheritance.
- All inheritance in Java is public unlike C++.

- Subclasses have more functionality than their super classes.
- When designing classes, you place the most general methods in the superclass and more specialized methods in its subclasses.
### Overriding Methods
- When the child class implements a function having the same prototype as that of it's parent's, it is called function overriding .
- The call to the intended function is resolved at runtime, which is called **dynamic binding**.
- An object reference can refer to multiple actual types (parent/child class type), which is called **polymorphism**.
- ![[Pasted image 20230805102317.png]]
- When `e` refers to a `Manager` object, then the `getSalary` method of the Manager class is called.
- But `e` can't access the member variables and methods of `Manager` class as it is an object reference of `Employee` type. 
- `super` is a keyword that directs the compiler to invoke the super class method.
### Subclass Constructor
- In a subclass constructor the call using `super` must be the first statement.
- If the subclass constructor does not call a superclass constructor explicitly, the no-argument constructor of the superclass is invoked.
- If the superclass does not have a no-argument constructor and the subclass constructor does not call another superclass constructor explicitly, the Java compiler reports an error.

### Inheritance Hierarchies
- Java supports Single, multi-level, hierarchical and hybrid inheritance.
- It doesn't support multiple inheritance in classes.

### Polymorphism
- Same name but different functionalities.
- In the Java programming language, object variables are polymorphic.
- For example:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230806131535.png]]
	- A variable of type `Employee` can refer to an object of type `Employee` or to an object of any subclass of the `Employee` class (such as `Manager`, `Executive`, `Secretary`, and so on).
	- But it can only access those members that belongs to the `Employee` class.
- You cannot assign a superclass reference to a subclass variable.

### Understanding Method calls
- If the method is `private`, `static`, `final`, or a `constructor`, then the compiler knows exactly which method to call. This is called **static binding**.
- When you override a method, the subclass method must be at least as visible as the superclass method. 
	- In particular, if the superclass method is `public`, the subclass method must also be declared `public`.

### Preventing Inheritance
- `final` Classes can't be extended.
- No subclass can override a `final` method.
- All methods in a `final` class are automatically `final`, but not the instance fields.
- Use `instanceof` to check before casting from a superclass to a subclass.

### Abstract Classes
- A class with one or more abstract methods must itself be declared abstract.
- If you use the abstract keyword, you do not need to implement the method at all.
- In addition to abstract methods, abstract classes can have fields and concrete methods.
- ![[Pasted image 20230806133448.png]]
- When you extend an abstract class, you have two choices. 
	- You can leave some or all of the abstract methods undefined; then you must tag the subclass as abstract as well. 
	- Or you can define all methods, and the subclass is no longer abstract.
- A class can even be declared as abstract though it has no abstract methods.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but you can still create object variables of an abstract class and the compiler ensures that you invoke only methods that are declared in the abstract class using the object variable of the abstract class.
