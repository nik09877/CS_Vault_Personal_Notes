# Classes, Super classes and Sub classes
### Defining Subclasses
- Use the Java keyword `extends` to denote inheritance.
- All inheritance in Java is public unlike C++.

- Subclasses have more functionality than their super classes.
- When designing classes, you place the most general methods in the superclass and more specialized methods in its subclasses.
### Overriding Methods
- When the child class implements a function having the same prototype as that of it's parent's, it is called function overriding .
- The call to the intended function is resolved at runtime, which is called **dynamic binding**.
- An object reference can refer to multiple actual types (parent/child class type), which is called **polymorphism**.

- When `e` refers to a `Manager` object, then the `getSalary` method of the Manager class is called.
- But `e` can't access the member variables and methods of `Manager` class as it is an object reference of `Employee` type. 
- `super` is a keyword that directs the compiler to invoke the super class method.
### Subclass Constructor
- In a subclass constructor the call using `super` must be the first statement.
- If the subclass constructor does not call a superclass constructor explicitly, the no-argument constructor of the superclass is invoked.
- If the superclass does not have a no-argument constructor and the subclass constructor does not call another superclass constructor explicitly, the Java compiler reports an error.
