# Input/Output Streams
- An object from which we can read a sequence of bytes is called an input stream.
- An object to which we can write a sequence of bytes is called an output stream.
- The **abstract** classes `InputStream` and `OutputStream` form the basis for a hierarchy of I/O classes.
- As the `unicode` uses *multiple bytes* per character, a separate hierarchy provides classes for processing Unicode characters that inherit from the abstract `Reader` and `Writer` classes. These classes have read and write operations that are based on two-byte char values (that is, UTF-16 code units, as an integer between 0 and 65535) rather than byte values.

### Reading and Writing Bytes
- `System.in` is a predefined object of a subclass of `InputStream` that allows you to read information from standard input.
- In the `FileInputStream` class, `read` method reads one byte from a file.
- Both the `read` and `write` methods block until the byte is actually read or written. 
	- This means that if the `input stream` cannot immediately be accessed (usually because of a busy network connection), the **current thread blocks**. This gives other threads the chance to do useful work while the method is waiting for the input stream to become available again.
- When you have finished reading or writing to an input/output stream, close it by calling the `close` method.
	- This call frees up the operating system resources
	- Closing an output stream also flushes the buffer used for the output stream
	- You can also manually flush the output with the `flush` method.

- `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` let you read and write all the ***primitive Java types in binary format***.
- The `ZipInputStream` and `ZipOutputStream` let you read and write files in the familiar ***ZIP compression format***.
- There are four additional interfaces: `Closeable`, `Flushable`, `Readable`, and `Appendable`
