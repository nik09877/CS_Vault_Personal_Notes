# Input/Output Streams
- An object from which we can read a sequence of bytes is called an input stream.
- An object to which we can write a sequence of bytes is called an output stream.
- The **abstract** classes `InputStream` and `OutputStream` form the basis for a hierarchy of I/O classes.
- As the `unicode` uses *multiple bytes* per character, a separate hierarchy provides classes for processing Unicode characters that inherit from the abstract `Reader` and `Writer` classes. These classes have read and write operations that are based on two-byte char values (that is, UTF-16 code units, as an integer between 0 and 65535) rather than byte values.

### Reading and Writing Bytes
- `System.in` is a predefined object of a subclass of `InputStream` that allows you to read information from standard input.
- In the `FileInputStream` class, `read` method reads one byte from a file.
- Both the `read` and `write` methods block until the byte is actually read or written. 
	- This means that if the `input stream` cannot immediately be accessed (usually because of a busy network connection), the **current thread blocks**. This gives other threads the chance to do useful work while the method is waiting for the input stream to become available again.
- When you have finished reading or writing to an input/output stream, close it by calling the `close` method.
	- This call frees up the operating system resources
	- Closing an output stream also flushes the buffer used for the output stream
	- You can also manually flush the output with the `flush` method.

### The Complete Stream Zoo

![](Pasted_image_20230813141653.png)

![](Pasted_image_20230813141710.png)

- `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` let you read and write all the ***primitive Java types in binary format***.
- The `ZipInputStream` and `ZipOutputStream` let you read and write files in the familiar ***ZIP compression format***.
- There are four additional interfaces: `Closeable`, `Flushable`, `Readable`, and `Appendable`

### Combining Input/Output Stream Filters
- `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` give you input and output streams attached to a disk file.
- You need to pass the file name or full path name of the file to the constructor.
```Java
FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream("employee.dat"); 
//looks in the user directory for a file named employee.dat.
```
- To be able to read numbers from a file, first create a `FileInputStream` and then pass it to the constructor of a `DataInputStream`.
```Java
FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream("employee.dat"); DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream(fin); 
double x = din.readDouble();
```

# Text Input and Output
- When you want to save data in text format they are stored as "strings"/
- The `InputStreamReader` class turns an input stream that contains **bytes** into a reader that emits Unicode code units.
- The `OutputStreamWriter` class turns an output stream of Unicode code units into a stream of bytes.
- Here is how you make an input reader that reads keystrokes from the console and converts them to Unicode :
```Java
Reader in = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
```
- You should always choose a specific encoding in the constructor for the `InputStreamReader`, for example :
```Java
Reader in = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("data.txt"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

### How to Write Text Output
- For text output, use a `PrintWriter` class that has methods to print strings and numbers in text format.
```Java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter("employee.txt", "UTF-8");
// is equivalent to 
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter( 
new FileOutputStream("employee.txt"), "UTF-8");
```
- To write to a print writer, use the same `print`, `println`, and `printf` methods that you used with `System.out`.
```Java
String name = "Harry Hacker"; 
double salary = 75000; 
out.print(name); 
out.print(' '); 
out.println(salary);
// This writes the characters Harry Hacker 75000.0 
//to the writer out.
```
- The characters are then converted to bytes and end up in the file employee.txt.
- If the writer is set to `autoflush` mode, all characters in the buffer are sent to their destination whenever `println` is called.
- You can enable or disable `autoflushing` by using the `PrintWriter(Writer writer, boolean autoFlush)` constructor.

### How to Read Text Input
- The easiest way to process arbitrary text is the Scanner class. You can construct a `Scanner` from any input stream.
- you can read a short text file into a string like this :
```Java
String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(path),charset);
```
- But if you want the file as a sequence of lines, call :
```Java
List<String>lines = Files.readAllLines(path,charset);
```
- If the file is large, process the lines lazily :
```Java
try(Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path,charset))
{
	. . .
}
```
- `BufferedReader` class has a `readLine` method that yields a line of text, or `null` when no more input is available.
```Java
InputStream inputStream = . . .; 
try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) 
{ 
	String line; 
	while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) 
	{ do something with line } 
}
```
- The `BufferedReader` class also has a `lines` method that yields a `Stream<String>`.
- A `BufferedReader` has no methods for reading numbers.

### Character Encodings
- Characters are encoded into bytes.
- Java uses the Unicode standard for characters.
- Each character or “code point” has a 21-bit integer number.
- There are different character encodings—methods for packaging those 21-bit numbers into bytes.
- The most common encoding is UTF-8, which encodes each Unicode code point into a sequence of one to four bytes.
- Another common encoding is UTF-16, which encodes each Unicode code point into one or two 16-bit values. This is the encoding used in Java strings.

# Reading and Writing Binary Data
# Object Input/Output Streams and Serialization
# Working With Files
- The `Path interface` and `Files class` encapsulate the functionality required to work with the file system on the user’s machine.
### Paths
- A `Path` is a sequence of directory names, optionally followed by a file name.
- The first component of a path may be a root component such as `/` or `C:\`.
- A path that starts with a root component is **absolute**. Otherwise, it is **relative**.
- A path does not have to correspond to a file that actually exists. It is merely an abstract sequence of names.As you will see in the next section, when you want to create a file, you first make a path and then call a method to create the corresponding file.
##### Paths.get()
The static `Paths.get` method receives one or more strings, which it joins with the path separator of the default file system (`/` for a UNIX-like file system, `\` for Windows). It then parses the result, throwing an `InvalidPathException` if the result is not a valid path in the given file system.The result is a Path object.
```Java
Path absolute = Paths.get("/home", "harry"); 
Path relative = Paths.get("myprog", "conf", "user.properties");
```
##### resolve()
- It is very common to combine or resolve paths.
- The call `p.resolve(q)` returns a path according to these rules :
	- If q is absolute, then the result is q.
	- • Otherwise, the result is “p then q,” according to the rules of the file system.
```Java
//For example, suppose your application needs to find its working directory relative to a given base directory that is read from a configuration file, as in the preceding example.
Path workRelative = Paths.get("work"); 
Path workPath = basePath.resolve(workRelative);

//There is a shortcut for the resolve method that takes a string instead of a path:
Path workPath = basePath.resolve("work");
```

##### resolveSibling()
- It resolves against a path’s parent, yielding a sibling path.
```Java
//For example, if workPath is /opt/myapp/work, the call
Path tempPath = workPath.resolveSibling("temp");
//creates /opt/myXapp/temp.
```

##### relativize()
- It is the opposite of `resolve`.
- The call `p.relativize(r)` yields the path q which, when resolved with p, yields r.
- For example, relativizing `home/harry` against `/home/fred/input.txt` yields `../fred/input.txt`.

##### normalize()
- The `normalize` method removes any redundant `.` and `..` components.
- For example, normalizing the path` /home/harry/../fred/./input.txt` yields `/home/fred/input.txt`

##### toAbsolutePath()
- The `toAbsolutePath` method yields the absolute path of a given path, starting at a root component, such as `/home/fred/input.txt` or `c:\Users\fred\input.txt`.

#### Path Interface
The `Path` interface has many useful methods for taking `paths` apart.
```Java
Path p = Paths.get("/home", "fred", "myprog.properties"); 
Path parent = p.getParent(); // the path /home/fred 
Path file = p.getFileName(); // the path myprog.properties 
Path root = p.getRoot(); // the path /
```

### Reading and Writing Files
- The `Files` class makes quick work of common file operations.
- you can easily read the entire contents of a file :
```Java
byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(path);
```
- If you want to read the file as a string :
```Java
byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(path);
String content = new String(bytes, charset);
```
- if you want the file as a sequence of lines, call :
```Java
List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(path, charset);
```

- if you want to write a string, call :
```Java
Files.write(path, content.getBytes(charset));
```
- To append to a given file, use :
```Java
Files.write(path, content.getBytes(charset), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
```
- You can also write a collection of lines with :
```Java
Files.write(path, lines);
```

- If your files are large or binary, you can still use the familiar input/output streams or readers/writers :
```Java
InputStream in = Files.newInputStream(path); 
OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path); 
Reader in = Files.newBufferedReader(path, charset); 
Writer out = Files.newBufferedWriter(path, charset);
```
- These convenience methods save you from dealing with `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `BufferedReader`, or `BufferedWriter`.

#### API
![](Pasted_image_20230814144800.png)

### Creating Files and Directories
- To create a new directory, call
```Java
//All but the last component in the path must already exist.
Files.createDirectory(path);

//To create intermediate directories
Files.createDirectories(path);
```
- Create empty file by calling :
```Java
Files.createFile(path);
```
- This call throws an exception if the file already exists. The check for existence and creation are atomic. If the file doesn’t exist, it is created before anyone else has a chance to do the same.
#### API
![](Pasted_image_20230814160751.png)

### Copying, Moving, and Deleting Files
- To copy a file from one location to another, simply call
```Java
Files.copy(fromPath,toPath);
```
- To move a file(i.e copy and delete the original)
```Java
Files.move(fromPath,toPath);
```
- The copy or move will fail if the target exists. If you want to overwrite an existing target, use the `REPLACE_EXISTING` option. If you want to copy all file attributes, use the `COPY_ATTRIBUTES` option. You can supply both like this :
```Java
Files.copy(fromPath, toPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING, StandardCopyOption.COPY_ATTRIBUTES);
```
- You can specify that a move should be atomic. Then you are assured that either the move completed successfully, or the source continues to be present. Use the `ATOMIC_MOVE` option :
```Java
Files.move(fromPath, toPath, StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE);
```
- You can also copy an input stream to a `Path`, which just means saving the input stream to disk. Similarly, you can copy a `Path` to an output stream. Use the following calls :
```Java
Files.copy(inputStream, toPath); 
Files.copy(fromPath, outputStream);
```
- Finally, to delete a file, simply call
```Java
Files.delete(path);
```
- This method throws an exception if the file doesn’t exist, so instead you may want to use :
```Java
boolean deleted = Files.deleteIfExists(path);
```
- The deletion methods can also be used to remove an empty directory.

### Getting File Information
- All file systems report a set of basic attributes, encapsulated by the `BasicFileAttributes` interface, which partially overlaps with that information. The basic file attributes are :
	- The times at which the file was created, last accessed, and last modified, as instances of the class `java.nio.file.attribute.FileTime`
	- Whether the file is a regular file, a directory, a symbolic link, or none of these
	- The file size
	- The file key—an object of some class, specific to the file system, that may or may not uniquely identify a file
- To get these attributes, call :
```Java
BasicFileAttributes attributes = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);
```
#### API
![](Pasted_image_20230814161932.png)

### Visiting Directory Entries
- The static `Files.list` method returns a `Stream<Path>` that reads the entries of a directory. 
- The directory is read lazily, making it possible to efficiently process directories with huge numbers of entries. 
- Since reading a directory involves a system resource that needs to be closed, you should use a `try block` :
```Java
try (Stream<Path> entries = Files.list(pathToDirectory)
{
	. . .
}
```
- The `list` method does not enter subdirectories.
- To process all descendants of a directory, use the `Files.walk` method instead
```Java
try (Stream<Path> entries = Files.walk(pathToRoot)
{
	// Contains all descendants, visited in depth-first order
}
```
- This code fragment uses the Files.walk method to copy one directory to another :
```Java
Files.walk(source).forEach(p -> 
{ 
	try
	{ 
		Path q = target.resolve(source.relativize(p)); 
		if (Files.isDirectory(p)) Files.createDirectory(q); 
		else Files.copy(p, q); 
	} 
	catch (IOException ex) { throw new UncheckedIOException(ex); } });
```

### Using Directory Streams
- `Files.newDirectoryStream` object yields a `DirectoryStream`.
- It is a specialized directory traversal sub interface of `Iterable` so that you can use directory stream in an enhanced for loop.
```Java
try (DirectoryStream<Path> entries = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir))
{
	for (Path entry : entries) Process entries 
}
```
- You can filter the files with a glob pattern :
```Java
try (DirectoryStream<Path> entries = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.java"))
```

#### Glob pattern
![](Pasted_image_20230814163120.png)

- If you want to visit all descendants of a directory, call the `walkFileTree` method instead and supply an object of type `FileVisitor`. That object gets notified
	- When a file is encountered: `FileVisitResult visitFile(T path, BasicFileAttributes attrs)` 
	- Before a directory is processed: `FileVisitResult preVisitDirectory(T dir, IOException ex)`
	- After a directory is processed: `FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(T dir, IOException ex)`
	- When an error occurred trying to visit a file or directory, such as trying to open a directory without the necessary permissions: `FileVisitResult visitFileFailed(T path, IOException ex)`
- In each case, you can specify whether you want to
	- Continue visiting the next file: `FileVisitResult.CONTINUE`
	- Continue the walk, but without visiting the entries in this directory: `FileVisitResult.SKIP_SUBTREE`
	- Continue the walk, but without visiting the siblings of this file: `FileVisitResult.SKIP_SIBLINGS`
	- Terminate the walk: `FileVisitResult.TERMINATE`
- If any of the methods throws an exception, the walk is also terminated, and that exception is thrown from the `walkFileTree` method
- A convenience class `SimpleFileVisitor` implements the `FileVisitor` interface. All but the `visitFileFailed` method do nothing and continue. The `visitFileFailed` method throws the exception that caused the failure, thereby terminating the visit.
- For example, here is how you can print out all subdirectories of a given directory :
```Java
Files.walkFileTree(Paths.get("/"), new SimpleFileVisitor<Path>()
{ 
	public FileVisitResult preVisitDirectory(Path path, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException 
	{ 
		System.out.println(path); return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE; 
	} 
	
	public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(Path dir, IOException exc) 
	{ return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE; } 
	
	public FileVisitResult visitFileFailed(Path path, IOException exc) throws IOException 
	{ return FileVisitResult.SKIP_SUBTREE; } });
```
- When you delete a directory tree, you need to remove the current directory after you have removed all of its files. Here is the complete code for deleting a directory tree :
```Java
Files.walkFileTree(root, new SimpleFileVisitor<Path>() 
	{
		public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException 
		{ 
			Files.delete(file); return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE; 
		}
	
		public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(Path dir, IOException e) throws IOException 
		{ 
			if (e != null) throw e; 
			 Files.delete(dir); 
			 return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE; 
		} 
	}
);
```

### Zip File System
- The Paths class looks up paths in the default file system—the files on the user’s local disk. 
- You can have other file systems. One of the more useful ones is a ZIP file system. 
- If let `zipname` is the name of a ZIP file, then the call :
```Java
FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(Paths.get(zipname), null);
```
- establishes a file system that contains all files in the ZIP archive. 
- It’s an easy matter to copy a file out of that archive if you know its name :
```Java
Files.copy(fs.getPath(sourceName), targetPath);
```
- Here, `fs.getPath` is the analog of `Paths.get` for an arbitrary file system :
- To list all files in a ZIP archive, walk the file tree :
```Java
FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(Paths.get(zipname), null);
Files.walkFileTree(fs.getPath("/"), new SimpleFileVisitor<Path>()
{
	public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException
	{
		System.out.println(file); return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
	}
});
```
