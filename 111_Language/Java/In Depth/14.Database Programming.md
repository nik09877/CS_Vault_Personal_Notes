# The Design of JDBC
- Java provides a pure Java API for SQL access along with a driver manager to allow third-party drivers to connect to specific databases. 
- Database vendors could provide their own drivers to plug into the driver manager. 
- There would then be a simple mechanism for registering third-party drivers with the driver manager. 
- This organization follows the very successful model of Microsoft’s ODBC which provided a C programming language interface for database access. 
- Both JDBC and ODBC are based on the same idea : 
	- Programs written according to the API talk to the driver manager, which, in turn, uses a driver to talk to the actual database.
### JDBC Driver Types
1. A `type 1` driver translates `JDBC` to `ODBC` and relies on an `ODBC driver` to communicate with the `database`. 
	- Early versions of Java included one such driver, the `JDBC/ODBC bridge`.
	- JDK no longer provides the `JDBC/ODBC bridge`.
2. A `type 2` driver is written partly in Java and partly in native code. 
	- It communicates with the client API of a database. 
	- To use such a driver, you must install some platform-specific code onto the client in addition to a Java library.
3. A `type 3` driver is a pure Java client library that uses a database independent protocol to communicate database requests to a server component, which then translates the requests into a database-specific protocol. 
	- This simplifies deployment because the platform-specific code is located only on the server.
4. A `type 4` driver is a pure Java library that translates JDBC requests directly to a database-specific protocol.
- Most database vendors supply either a type 3 or type 4 driver with their database
### The ultimate goal of JDBC is to make possible the following:
- Programmers can write applications in the Java programming language to access any database using standard SQL statements (or even specialized extensions of SQL) while still following Java language conventions.
- Database vendors and database tool vendors can supply the low-level drivers. Thus, they can optimize their drivers for their specific products.
### Why Java didn't adopt ODBC model ?
- ODBC is hard to learn.
- ODBC has a few commands with lots of complex options. The preferred style in the Java programming language is to have simple and intuitive methods, but to have lots of them.
- ODBC relies on the use of void* pointers and other C features that are not natural in the Java programming language.
- An ODBC-based solution is inherently less safe and harder to deploy than a pure Java solution.
### Typical Uses of JDBC
#### Tradition Client/Server application
- The traditional client/server model has a rich GUI on the client and a database on the server. 
- In this model, a JDBC driver is deployed on the client.

#### 3-tier architecture
- Nowadays it is far more common to have a three-tier model where the client application does not make database calls. 
- Instead, it calls on a middleware layer on the server that in turn makes the database queries. 
- The three-tier model has a couple of advantages :
	- It separates visual presentation (on the client) from the business logic (in the middle tier) and the raw data (in the database). 
	- Therefore, it becomes possible to access the same data and the same business rules from multiple clients, such as a Java desktop application, a web browser, or a mobile app. 
	- Communication between the client and the middle tier typically occurs through HTTP. 
	- JDBC manages the communication between the middle tier and the back-end database.

-  ![](Pasted_image_20231008123418.png)

# The Structured Query Language
- JDBC lets you communicate with databases using SQL, which is the command language for essentially all modern relational databases. 
- The **JDBC package is an API for communicating SQL statements to databases**.
- A database has a bunch of named tables with rows and columns. Each column has a column name. Each row contains a set of related data.
- The **benefit of joining tables** **is avoiding unnecessary duplication of data in the database tables**.
- **In the relational model, we distribute data into multiple tables so that no information is unnecessarily duplicated.**

### SQL
1. Note that strings are enclosed in single quotes, not double quotes. A single quote inside a string is represented by a pair of single quotes.
```sql
SELECT Title FROM Books WHERE Title LIKE '%''%' 
 -- reports all titles that contain a single quote.
```
2. You can select data from multiple tables :
```sql
SELECT * FROM Books, Publishers
```
- Without a `WHERE` clause, this query is not very interesting. It lists all combinations of rows from both tables.
3. Whenever you have multiple tables in a query, the same column name can occur in two different places.
	- When an ambiguity would otherwise result, you must prefix each column name with the name of the table to which it belongs, such as `Books.Publisher_Id`.
4. You need a separate `INSERT` statement for every row being inserted in the table.

#### Common SQL Data Types

![](Pasted_image_20231008124747.png)

# JDBC Configuration
- You need a database program for which a JDBC driver is available. 
- There are many excellent choices, such as IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.
### Database URLs
- When connecting to a database, you must use various database-specific parameters such as `host names`, `port numbers`, and `database names`.
```java
jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/COREJAVA;create=true 
jdbc:postgresql:COREJAVA
```
- These JDBC URLs specify a Derby database and a PostgreSQL database named `COREJAVA`.
- The general syntax is :
```java
jdbc:subprotocol:other stuff
```
- where a subprotocol selects the specific driver for connecting to the database.
### Driver JAR Files
- You need to obtain the JAR file in which the driver for your database is located.
- Include the driver JAR file on the class path when running a program that accesses the database. 
- You don’t need the JAR file for compiling.
- When you launch programs from the command line, simply use the command
>	java -classpath driverPath:. ProgramName

- On Windows, use a semicolon to separate the current directory (denoted by the . character) from the driver JAR location.
### Starting the Database
- The database server needs to be started before you can connect to it.
- With the Derby database, follow these steps:
	1. Open a command shell and change to a directory that will hold the database files.
	2. Locate the file `derbyrun.jar`. With some versions of the JDK, it is contained in the` jdk/db/lib` directory. If it’s not there, install Apache Derby and locate the JAR file in the installation directory. We will denote the directory containing `lib/derbyrun.jar` with *derby*.
	3. Run the command `java -jar derby/lib/derbyrun.jar server start`
	4. Double-check that the database is working correctly. Create a file `ij.properties` that contains these lines:
		- ` ij.driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver ij.protocol=jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/ ij.database=COREJAVA;create=true`
		- From another command shell, run Derby’s interactive scripting tool (called ij) by executing `java -jar derby/lib/derbyrun.jar ij -p ij.properties`
		- Now you can issue SQL commands such as:
		- `CREATE TABLE Greetings (Message CHAR(20)); INSERT INTO Greetings VALUES ('Hello, World!'); SELECT * FROM Greetings; DROP TABLE Greetings;`
		- Note that each command must be terminated by a semicolon. To exit, type `EXIT;`
	5. When you are done using the database, stop the server with the command `java -jar derby/lib/derbyrun.jar server shutdown`

### Registering the Driver Class #unfinished 
### Connecting to the Database
- In your Java program, open a database connection like this:
```java
String url = "jdbc:postgresql:COREJAVA"; 
String username = "dbuser"; 
String password = "secret"; 
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
```
- The driver manager iterates through the registered drivers to find a driver that can use the subprotocol specified in the database URL.
- The `getConnection` method returns a `Connection` object.
- You will see how to use the `Connection` object to execute SQL statements.
- To connect to the database, you will need a user name and password for your database.

# Working with JDBC Statements
### Executing SQL Statement
- You first create a `Statement` object. 
- To create `statement` objects, use the `Connection` object that you obtained from the call to `DriverManager.getConnection`.
```java
Statement stat = conn.createStatement();
```
- Next, place the statement that you want to execute into a string
```java
String command = "UPDATE Books" + 
" SET Price = Price - 5.00" +
" WHERE Title NOT LIKE '%Introduction%'";
```
- Then, call the `executeUpdate` method of the `Statement` **interface**:
```java
stat.executeUpdate(command);
```
- The `executeUpdate` method returns a count of the rows that were affected by the SQL statement, or zero for statements that do not return a row count.
- The `executeUpdate` method can execute actions such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, as well as data definition statements such as `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`.
- However, you need to use the `executeQuery` method to execute `SELECT` queries.
- There is also a catch-all `execute` statement to execute arbitrary SQL statements. It’s commonly used only for queries that a user supplies interactively.
- The `executeQuery` object returns an object of type `ResultSet` that you can use to walk through the result **one row at a time**.
```java
ResultSet rs = stat.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Books");
while(rs.next())
{
	// look at a row of the result set
}
```
#### Caution
The iteration protocol of the `ResultSet` interface is subtly different from that of the `java.util.Iterator` interface. Here, the iterator is **initialized to a position before the first row**. You must call the `next` method once to move the iterator to the first row. Also, there is no `hasNext` method; keep calling `next` until it returns `false`

#### Accessing row data
- The order of the rows in a result set is completely arbitrary. Unless you specifically ordered the result with an` ORDER BY` clause
- Unlike array indexes, **database column numbers start at 1**.
```java
String isbn = rs.getString(1); 
double price = rs.getDouble("Price");
```
- Each accessor has two forms
	- one taking a numeric argument
		- When you supply a numeric argument, you refer to the column with that number.
	- and the other, a string argument.
		- When you supply a string argument, you refer to the column in the result set with that name.
- Using the numeric argument is a bit more efficient.
- Each get method makes **reasonable type conversions** when the type of the method doesn’t match the type of the column.
	- For example, the call `rs.getString("Price")` converts the **floating-point value** of the Price column to a **string**.

### Managing Connections, Statements, and Result Sets
- Every `Connection` object can create one or more `Statement` objects. 
- You can use the same `Statement` object for multiple unrelated commands and queries. 
- However, a `statement` has **at most one open result set**. 
- If you issue multiple queries whose results you analyze concurrently, you need multiple `Statement` objects. 
- There is a limit to the number of statements per connection. 
- Use the `getMaxStatements` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` interface to find out the number of concurrently open statements that your `JDBC` driver supports. 
- It is much more efficient to let the database combine queries than it is for a Java program to iterate through multiple result sets. 
- Be sure to finish processing of any result set before you issue a new query or update on a `Statement` object. The `result sets` of prior queries are automatically closed. 
- When you are done using a `ResultSet`, `Statement`, or `Connection`, it is a good idea to call the `close` method immediately. 
- **These objects use large data structures** that draw on the finite resources of the database server. 
- The `close` method of a `Statement` object closes **any associated result sets**. 
- Similarly, the `close` method of the `Connection` class closes **all statements of the connection**. 
- Conversely, you can call the `closeOnCompletion` method on a `Statement`, and it will close automatically as soon as all its result sets have closed. 
- If your connections are short-lived, make sure a connection object cannot possibly remain open, so use a `try-with-resources` statement:
```java
try (Connection conn = . . .) 
{ 
	Statement stat = conn.createStatement(); 
	ResultSet result = stat.executeQuery(queryString); 
	// process query result 
}
```

### Analyzing SQL Exceptions #unfinished 

### Populating a Database
The following steps briefly describe the `ExecSQL` program: 

1. Connect to the database. The `getConnection` method reads the properties in the file `database.properties` and adds the `jdbc.drivers` property to the system properties. The driver manager uses the `jdbc.drivers` property to load the appropriate database driver. The `getConnection` method uses the `jdbc.url`, `jdbc.username`, and` jdbc.password` properties to open the database connection. 
2. Open the file with the SQL statements. If no file name was supplied, prompt the user to enter the statements on the console. 
3. Execute each statement with the generic execute method. If it returns true, the statement had a result set. The four SQL files that we provide for the book database all end in a `SELECT *` statement so that you can see that the data were successfully inserted. 
4. If there was a result set, print out the result. Since this is a generic result set, we need to use metadata to find out how many columns the result has. For more information, see Section 5.8, “Metadata,” on p. 343. 
5. If there is any SQL exception, print the exception and any chained exceptions that may be contained in it. 
6. Close the connection to the database.

- Below code reads a file with SQL statements and executes them so you can populate your database.
- Make sure that your database server is running, and run the program as follows :

>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL Books.sql 
>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL Authors.sql 
>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL Publishers.sql 
>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL BooksAuthors.sql

- Before running the program, check that the file `database.properties` is set up properly for your environment

# Query Execution
### Prepared Statements
- We can write an SQL query in advance that has some variables , save it and re-use it by just setting the variable to a new value.
- So we can prepare a query with a host variable and use it many times, each time filling in a different string for the variable. 
- That technique improves performance. 
- Whenever the database executes a query, it first computes a strategy of how to do it efficiently. 
- By preparing the query and reusing it, you ensure that the planning step is done only once.
- Each host variable in a prepared query is indicated with a `?`.
- If there is more than one variable, you must keep track of the positions of the `?` when setting the values.
- Before executing the prepared statement, you must bind the host variables to actual values with a `set` method.
- As with the `get` methods of the `ResultSet` interface, there are different `set` methods for the various types.
```java
String publisherQuery = "SELECT Books.Price, Books.Title" 
+ " FROM Books, Publishers" 
+ " WHERE Books.Publisher_Id = Publishers.Publisher_Id AND Publishers.Name = ?"; 

PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement(publisherQuery);
stat.setString(1, publisher);
```
- The first argument is the position number of the host variable that we want to set. 
- The position `1` denotes the first `?`. The second argument is the value that we want to assign to the host variable.
- If you reuse a prepared query that you have already executed, all host variables stay bound unless you change them with a `set` method or call the `clearParameters` method. 
- That means you only need to call a `setXxx` method on those host variables that change from one query to the next.
- Once all variables have been bound to values, you can execute the prepared statement:
```java
ResultSet rs = stat.executeQuery();
```
- A `PreparedStatement` object becomes invalid after the associated `Connection` object is closed. 
- However, many databases automatically cache prepared statements. 
- If the same query is prepared twice, the database simply reuses the query strategy. 
- Therefore, don’t worry about the overhead of calling `prepareStatement`

### Reading and Writing LOBs
- Many databases can store large objects (LOBs) such as images or other data. 
- In SQL, binary large objects are called **BLOBs**, and character large objects are called **CLOBs**
- To read a `LOB`, execute a `SELECT` statement and call the `getBlob` or `getClob` method on the `ResultSet`. You will get an object of type `Blob` or `Clob`. To get the binary data from a `Blob`, call the `getBytes` or `getBinaryStream`.
- Similarly, if you retrieve a `Clob` object, you can get character data by calling the `getSubString` or `getCharacterStream` method.

```java
PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT Cover FROM BookCovers WHERE ISBN=?");
. . .
stat.set(1, isbn);
try (ResultSet result = stat.executeQuery()) 
{ 
	if (result.next()) 
	{ 
		Blob coverBlob = result.getBlob(1); 
		Image coverImage = ImageIO.read(coverBlob.getBinaryStream());
	} 
}
```
- To place a `LOB` into a database, call `createBlob` or `createClob` on your `Connection` object, get an `output stream` or `writer` to the `LOB`, write the data, and store the object in the database.
```java
Blob coverBlob = connection.createBlob(); 
int offset = 0; 

OutputStream out = coverBlob.setBinaryStream(offset);

ImageIO.write(coverImage, "PNG", out); 

PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO Cover VALUES (?, ?)"); 

stat.set(1, isbn); 
stat.set(2, coverBlob); 
stat.executeUpdate();
```

### SQL Escapes #unfinished 
- It is the job of the JDBC driver to translate the escape syntax to the syntax of a particular database.
- Escapes are provided for the following features: 
	- Date and time literals 
	- Calling scalar functions 
	- Calling stored procedures 
	- Outer joins 
	- The escape character in LIKE clauses
### Multiple Results
- It is possible for a query to return multiple results. 
- This can happen when executing a stored procedure, or with databases that also allow submission of multiple SELECT statements in a single query. 
- Here is how you retrieve all result sets:
	1. Use the `execute` method to execute the SQL statement. 
	2. Retrieve the first result or update count. 
	3. Repeatedly call the `getMoreResults` method to move on to the next result set. 
	4. Finish when there are no more result sets or update counts
- The `execute` and `getMoreResults` methods return `true` if the next item in the chain is a result set. 
- The `getUpdateCount` method returns `-1` if the next item in the chain is not an update count.
```java
boolean isResult = stat.execute(command);
boolean done = false;
while(!done)
{
	if(isResult)
	{
		ResultSet result = stat.getResultSet();
		// do something with the result
	}
	else
	{
		//if it is not a result set it must be the update count
		//i.e the number of rows affected
		int updateCount = stat.getUpdateCount();
		if(updateCount >= 0)
		{
			//do something with the update count
		}
		else
			done = true;
	}
	if(!done) isResult = stat.getMoreResults();
}
```

### Retrieving Autogenerated Keys
- These automatic numbers are often used as primary keys. 
- Although JDBC doesn’t offer a vendor-independent solution for generating keys, it does provide an efficient way of retrieving them. 
- When you insert a new row into a table and a key is automatically generated, you can retrieve it with the following code:
```java
stat.executeUpdate(insertStatement, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);
ResultSet rs = stat.getGeneratedKeys(); 
if (rs.next()) 
{ 
	int key = rs.getInt(1); 
	. . . 
}
```

# Scrollable and Updatable Result Sets
- In a *scrollable* result, you can move forward and backward through a result set and even jump to any position.
- In an *updatable* result set, you can programmatically update entries so that the database is automatically updated.
### Scrollable Result Sets
- By default, result sets are not scrollable or updatable.
- You have to use the syntax :
```java
Statement stat = conn.createStatement(type, concurrency);
```
- For a prepared statement, use the call
```java
PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement(command, type, concurrency);
```
- For example, if you simply want to be able to scroll through a result set but don’t want to edit its data, use :
```java
Statement stat = conn.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
```
- All result sets that are returned by calls are now scrollable and a scrollable result set has a cursor that indicates the current position.
- Scrolling is very simple. Use below code to scroll backward :
```java
if (rs.previous()) . . .;
```
- The method returns true if the cursor is positioned on an actual row, or false if it is now positioned before the first row.
- You can move the cursor backward or forward by any number of rows with the call
```java
rs.relative(n);
```
- If n is positive, the cursor moves forward. If n is negative, it moves backward. If n is zero, the call has no effect.
- If you attempt to move the cursor outside the current set of rows, it is set to point either after the last row or before the first row, depending on the sign of n. Then, the method returns false and the cursor does not move. The method returns true if the cursor is positioned on an actual row.
- Alternatively, you can set the cursor to a particular row number:
```java
rs.absolute(n);
```
- To get the current row number, call
```java
int currentRow = rs.getRow();
```
- The first row in the result set has number 1. If the return value is 0, the cursor is not currently on a row—it is either before the first row or after the last row.
- The convenience methods `first`, `last`, `beforeFirst`, and `afterLast` move the cursor to the first, to the last, before the first, or after the last position.
- Finally, the methods `isFirst`, `isLast`, `isBeforeFirst`, and `isAfterLast` test whether the cursor is at one of these special positions.
- Using a scrollable result set is very simple. The hard work of caching the query data is carried out behind the scenes by the database driver.
#### ResultSet Type Values API
![[Pasted image 20231008215359.png]]

### Updatable Result Sets
- To obtain updatable result sets, create a statement as follows:
```java
Statement stat = conn.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
```
- The result sets returned by a call to `executeQuery` are then updatable
- Not all queries return updatable result sets. If your query is a `join` that involves multiple tables, the result might not be updatable. 
- However, if your query involves only a single table or if it joins multiple tables by their primary keys, you should expect the result set to be updatable. 
- Call the `getConcurrency` method of the `ResultSet` interface to find out for sure.
#### Example
##### Problem statement
Suppose you want to raise the prices of some books, but you don’t have a simple criterion for issuing an UPDATE statement. Then, you can iterate through all books and update prices based on arbitrary conditions.
##### Code
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM Books"; 
ResultSet rs = stat.executeQuery(query); 
while (rs.next()) { 
	if (. . .) { 
		double increase = . . .; 
		double price = rs.getDouble("Price"); 
		rs. updateDouble("Price", price + increase); 
		rs. updateRow(); 
		 
	} 
}
```
##### Notes
- make sure to call `updateRow` after updating fields which sends all updates in the current row to the database.
- If you move the cursor to another row without calling `updateRow`, this row’s updates are discarded from the row set and never communicated to the database. 
- You can also call the `cancelRowUpdates` method to cancel the updates to the current row.
- If you use the `updateXxx` method whose first parameter is the column number, be aware that this is the column number in the **result set**. It could well be different from the column number in the **database**.

#### How to insert a row ?
- Use the `moveToInsertRow` method to move the cursor to a special position, called the `insert row`. 
- Then, build up a new row in the insert row position by issuing `updateXxx` instructions. 
- When you are done, call the `insertRow` method to deliver the new row to the database. 
- When you are done inserting, call `moveToCurrentRow` to move the cursor back to the position before the call to `moveToInsertRow`.
```java
rs.moveToInsertRow(); 
rs.updateString("Title", title); 
rs.updateString("ISBN", isbn); 
rs.updateString("Publisher_Id", pubid); 
rs.updateDouble("Price", price); 
rs.insertRow(); 
rs.moveToCurrentRow();
```
- you cannot influence where the new data is added in the result set or the database.
- If you don’t specify a column value in the insert row, it is set to a SQL `NULL`. However, if the column has a `NOT NULL constraint`, an `exception` is thrown and the row is not inserted.
#### How to delete a row ?
- You can delete the row under the cursor:
```java
rs.deleteRow();
```
- This method immediately removes the row from both the result set and the database.

# Row Sets
- Scrollable result sets need to keep the database connection open during the entire user interaction, but row sets don’t have to be tied to a database connection.
- The `RowSet` interface extends the `ResultSet` interface
### Constructing Row Sets
- The` javax.sql.rowset` package provides the following interfaces that extend the `RowSet` interface:
	1. A `CachedRowSet` allows disconnected operation.
	2. A `WebRowSet` is a cached row set that can be saved to an XML file. The XML file can be moved to another tier of a web application where it is opened by another `WebRowSet` object.
	3. The `FilteredRowSet` and `JoinRowSet` interfaces support lightweight operations on row sets that are equivalent to `SQL SELECT` and `JOIN `operations. These operations are carried out on the data stored in row sets, without having to make a database connection.
	4. A `JdbcRowSet` is a thin wrapper around a `ResultSet`. It adds useful methods from the `RowSet` interface.
- To obtain a cached row set, call:
```java
RowSetFactory factory = RowSetProvider.newFactory(); 
CachedRowSet crs = factory.createCachedRowSet();
```

### Cached Row Sets
- You can close the connection and still use the row set.
- It is possible to modify the data in a cached row set. 
- The modifications are not immediately reflected in the database. 
- You need to make an explicit request to accept the accumulated changes. 
- The `CachedRowSet` then reconnects to the database and issues SQL statements to write the accumulated changes.
- You can populate a `CachedRowSet` from a result set:
```java
ResultSet result = . . .; 
RowSetFactory factory = RowSetProvider.newFactory(); 
CachedRowSet crs = factory.createCachedRowSet(); 
crs.populate(result); conn.close(); // now OK to close the database connection
```
- Alternatively, you can let the `CachedRowSet` object establish a connection automatically
- Set up the database parameters:
```java
crs.setURL("jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/COREJAVA"); crs.setUsername("dbuser"); 
crs.setPassword("secret");
```
- Then set the query statement and any parameters:
```java
crs.setCommand("SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher_ID = ?"); crs.setString(1, publisherId);
```
- Finally, populate the row set with the query result:
```java
crs.execute();
```
- This call establishes a database connection, issues the query, populates the row set, and disconnects.
- If your query result is very large, you would not want to put it into the row set in its entirety. After all, your users will probably only look at a few rows. In that case, specify a page size:
```java
CachedRowSet crs = . . .; 
crs.setCommand(command); 
crs.setPageSize(20); . . . 
crs.execute();
```
- Now you will only get 20 rows. 
- To get the next batch of rows, call :
```java
crs.nextPage();
```
- You can inspect and modify the row set with the same methods you use for result sets. 
- If you modified the row set contents, you must write it back to the database by calling
```java
crs.acceptChanges(conn);
// or
crs.acceptChanges();
/*
The second call works only if you configured the row set with the information required to connect to a database (such as the URL, user name, and password).
*/
```
>CAUTION:
>	If you populated the row set from a result set, the row set does not know the name of the table to update. You need to call setTableName to set the table name.

- Another complexity arises if the data in the database have changed after you populated the row set. This is clearly a sign of trouble that could lead to inconsistent data. The reference implementation checks whether the original row set values (that is, the values before editing) are identical to the current values in the database. If so, they are replaced with the edited values; otherwise, a `SyncProviderException` is thrown and none of the changes are written.

# Metadata
- In SQL, data that describe the database or one of its parts are called metadata.
- You can get **three** kinds of metadata: 
	- about a database
	- about a result set
	- about parameters of prepared statements
- To find out more about the database, request an object of type `DatabaseMetaData` from the database connection.
