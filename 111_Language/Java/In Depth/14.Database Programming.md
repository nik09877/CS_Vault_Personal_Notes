# The Design of JDBC
- Java provides a pure Java API for SQL access along with a driver manager to allow third-party drivers to connect to specific databases. 
- Database vendors could provide their own drivers to plug into the driver manager. 
- There would then be a simple mechanism for registering third-party drivers with the driver manager. 
- This organization follows the very successful model of Microsoftâ€™s ODBC which provided a C programming language interface for database access. 
- Both JDBC and ODBC are based on the same idea : 
	- Programs written according to the API talk to the driver manager, which, in turn, uses a driver to talk to the actual database.
### JDBC Driver Types
1. A `type 1` driver translates `JDBC` to `ODBC` and relies on an `ODBC driver` to communicate with the `database`. 
	- Early versions of Java included one such driver, the `JDBC/ODBC bridge`.
	- JDK no longer provides the `JDBC/ODBC bridge`.
2. A `type 2` driver is written partly in Java and partly in native code. 
	- It communicates with the client API of a database. 
	- To use such a driver, you must install some platform-specific code onto the client in addition to a Java library.
3. A `type 3` driver is a pure Java client library that uses a database independent protocol to communicate database requests to a server component, which then translates the requests into a database-specific protocol. This simplifies deployment because the platform-specific code is located only on the server.
