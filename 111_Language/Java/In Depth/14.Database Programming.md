# The Design of JDBC
- Java provides a pure Java API for SQL access along with a driver manager to allow third-party drivers to connect to specific databases. 
- Database vendors could provide their own drivers to plug into the driver manager. 
- There would then be a simple mechanism for registering third-party drivers with the driver manager. 
- This organization follows the very successful model of Microsoft’s ODBC which provided a C programming language interface for database access. 
- Both JDBC and ODBC are based on the same idea : 
	- Programs written according to the API talk to the driver manager, which, in turn, uses a driver to talk to the actual database.
### JDBC Driver Types
1. A `type 1` driver translates `JDBC` to `ODBC` and relies on an `ODBC driver` to communicate with the `database`. 
	- Early versions of Java included one such driver, the `JDBC/ODBC bridge`.
	- JDK no longer provides the `JDBC/ODBC bridge`.
2. A `type 2` driver is written partly in Java and partly in native code. 
	- It communicates with the client API of a database. 
	- To use such a driver, you must install some platform-specific code onto the client in addition to a Java library.
3. A `type 3` driver is a pure Java client library that uses a database independent protocol to communicate database requests to a server component, which then translates the requests into a database-specific protocol. 
	- This simplifies deployment because the platform-specific code is located only on the server.
4. A `type 4` driver is a pure Java library that translates JDBC requests directly to a database-specific protocol.
- Most database vendors supply either a type 3 or type 4 driver with their database
### The ultimate goal of JDBC is to make possible the following:
- Programmers can write applications in the Java programming language to access any database using standard SQL statements (or even specialized extensions of SQL) while still following Java language conventions.
- Database vendors and database tool vendors can supply the low-level drivers. Thus, they can optimize their drivers for their specific products.
### Why Java didn't adopt ODBC model ?
- ODBC is hard to learn.
- ODBC has a few commands with lots of complex options. The preferred style in the Java programming language is to have simple and intuitive methods, but to have lots of them.
- ODBC relies on the use of void* pointers and other C features that are not natural in the Java programming language.
- An ODBC-based solution is inherently less safe and harder to deploy than a pure Java solution.
### Typical Uses of JDBC
#### Tradition Client/Server application
- The traditional client/server model has a rich GUI on the client and a database on the server. 
- In this model, a JDBC driver is deployed on the client.

#### 3-tier architecture
- Nowadays it is far more common to have a three-tier model where the client application does not make database calls. 
- Instead, it calls on a middleware layer on the server that in turn makes the database queries. 
- The three-tier model has a couple of advantages :
	- It separates visual presentation (on the client) from the business logic (in the middle tier) and the raw data (in the database). 
	- Therefore, it becomes possible to access the same data and the same business rules from multiple clients, such as a Java desktop application, a web browser, or a mobile app. 
	- Communication between the client and the middle tier typically occurs through HTTP. 
	- JDBC manages the communication between the middle tier and the back-end database.

# The Structured Query Language
- JDBC lets you communicate with databases using SQL, which is the command language for essentially all modern relational databases. 
- The **JDBC package is an API for communicating SQL statements to databases**.
- A database has a bunch of named tables with rows and columns. Each column has a column name. Each row contains a set of related data.
- The **benefit of joining tables** **is avoiding unnecessary duplication of data in the database tables**.
- **In the relational model, we distribute data into multiple tables so that no information is unnecessarily duplicated.**

### SQL
1. Note that strings are enclosed in single quotes, not double quotes. A single quote inside a string is represented by a pair of single quotes.
```sql
SELECT Title FROM Books WHERE Title LIKE '%''%' 
 -- reports all titles that contain a single quote.
```
2. You can select data from multiple tables :
```sql
SELECT * FROM Books, Publishers
```
- Without a `WHERE` clause, this query is not very interesting. It lists all combinations of rows from both tables.
3. Whenever you have multiple tables in a query, the same column name can occur in two different places.
	- When an ambiguity would otherwise result, you must prefix each column name with the name of the table to which it belongs, such as `Books.Publisher_Id`.
4. You need a separate `INSERT` statement for every row being inserted in the table.

#### Common SQL Data Types

# JDBC Configuration
- You need a database program for which a JDBC driver is available. 
- There are many excellent choices, such as IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.
### Database URLs
- When connecting to a database, you must use various database-specific parameters such as `host names`, `port numbers`, and `database names`.
```java
jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/COREJAVA;create=true 
jdbc:postgresql:COREJAVA
```
- These JDBC URLs specify a Derby database and a PostgreSQL database named `COREJAVA`.
- The general syntax is :
```java
jdbc:subprotocol:other stuff
```
- where a subprotocol selects the specific driver for connecting to the database.
### Driver JAR Files
- You need to obtain the JAR file in which the driver for your database is located.
- Include the driver JAR file on the class path when running a program that accesses the database. 
- You don’t need the JAR file for compiling.
- When you launch programs from the command line, simply use the command
>	java -classpath driverPath:. ProgramName

- On Windows, use a semicolon to separate the current directory (denoted by the . character) from the driver JAR location.
### Starting the Database
- The database server needs to be started before you can connect to it.
- With the Derby database, follow these steps:
	1. Open a command shell and change to a directory that will hold the database files.
	2. Locate the file `derbyrun.jar`. With some versions of the JDK, it is contained in the` jdk/db/lib` directory. If it’s not there, install Apache Derby and locate the JAR file in the installation directory. We will denote the directory containing `lib/derbyrun.jar` with *derby*.
	3. Run the command `java -jar derby/lib/derbyrun.jar server start`
	4. Double-check that the database is working correctly. Create a file `ij.properties` that contains these lines:
		- ` ij.driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver ij.protocol=jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/ ij.database=COREJAVA;create=true`
		- From another command shell, run Derby’s interactive scripting tool (called ij) by executing `java -jar derby/lib/derbyrun.jar ij -p ij.properties`
		- Now you can issue SQL commands such as:
		- `CREATE TABLE Greetings (Message CHAR(20)); INSERT INTO Greetings VALUES ('Hello, World!'); SELECT * FROM Greetings; DROP TABLE Greetings;`
		- Note that each command must be terminated by a semicolon. To exit, type `EXIT;`
	5. When you are done using the database, stop the server with the command `java -jar derby/lib/derbyrun.jar server shutdown`

### Registering the Driver Class #unfinished 
### Connecting to the Database
- In your Java program, open a database connection like this:
```java
String url = "jdbc:postgresql:COREJAVA"; 
String username = "dbuser"; 
String password = "secret"; 
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
```
- The driver manager iterates through the registered drivers to find a driver that can use the subprotocol specified in the database URL.
- The `getConnection` method returns a `Connection` object.
- You will see how to use the `Connection` object to execute SQL statements.
- To connect to the database, you will need a user name and password for your database.

# Working with JDBC Statements
### Executing SQL Statement
- You first create a `Statement` object. 
- To create `statement` objects, use the `Connection` object that you obtained from the call to `DriverManager.getConnection`.
```java
Statement stat = conn.createStatement();
```
- Next, place the statement that you want to execute into a string
```java
String command = "UPDATE Books" + 
" SET Price = Price - 5.00" +
" WHERE Title NOT LIKE '%Introduction%'";
```
- Then, call the `executeUpdate` method of the `Statement` **interface**:
```java
stat.executeUpdate(command);
```
- The `executeUpdate` method returns a count of the rows that were affected by the SQL statement, or zero for statements that do not return a row count.
- The `executeUpdate` method can execute actions such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, as well as data definition statements such as `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`.
- However, you need to use the `executeQuery` method to execute `SELECT` queries.
- There is also a catch-all `execute` statement to execute arbitrary SQL statements. It’s commonly used only for queries that a user supplies interactively.
- The `executeQuery` object returns an object of type `ResultSet` that you can use to walk through the result **one row at a time**.
```java
ResultSet rs = stat.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Books");
while(rs.next())
{
	// look at a row of the result set
}
```
#### Caution
The iteration protocol of the `ResultSet` interface is subtly different from that of the `java.util.Iterator` interface. Here, the iterator is **initialized to a position before the first row**. You must call the `next` method once to move the iterator to the first row. Also, there is no `hasNext` method; keep calling `next` until it returns `false`

#### Accessing row data
- The order of the rows in a result set is completely arbitrary. Unless you specifically ordered the result with an` ORDER BY` clause
- Unlike array indexes, **database column numbers start at 1**.
```java
String isbn = rs.getString(1); 
double price = rs.getDouble("Price");
```
- Each accessor has two forms
	- one taking a numeric argument
		- When you supply a numeric argument, you refer to the column with that number.
	- and the other, a string argument.
		- When you supply a string argument, you refer to the column in the result set with that name.
- Using the numeric argument is a bit more efficient.
- Each get method makes **reasonable type conversions** when the type of the method doesn’t match the type of the column.
	- For example, the call `rs.getString("Price")` converts the **floating-point value** of the Price column to a **string**.

### Managing Connections, Statements, and Result Sets
- Every `Connection` object can create one or more `Statement` objects. 
- You can use the same `Statement` object for multiple unrelated commands and queries. 
- However, a `statement` has **at most one open result set**. 
- If you issue multiple queries whose results you analyze concurrently, you need multiple `Statement` objects. 
- There is a limit to the number of statements per connection. 
- Use the `getMaxStatements` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` interface to find out the number of concurrently open statements that your `JDBC` driver supports. 
- It is much more efficient to let the database combine queries than it is for a Java program to iterate through multiple result sets. 
- Be sure to finish processing of any result set before you issue a new query or update on a `Statement` object. The `result sets` of prior queries are automatically closed. 
- When you are done using a `ResultSet`, `Statement`, or `Connection`, it is a good idea to call the `close` method immediately. 
- **These objects use large data structures** that draw on the finite resources of the database server. 
- The `close` method of a `Statement` object closes **any associated result sets**. 
- Similarly, the `close` method of the `Connection` class closes **all statements of the connection**. 
- Conversely, you can call the `closeOnCompletion` method on a `Statement`, and it will close automatically as soon as all its result sets have closed. 
- If your connections are short-lived, make sure a connection object cannot possibly remain open, so use a `try-with-resources` statement:
```java
try (Connection conn = . . .) 
{ 
	Statement stat = conn.createStatement(); 
	ResultSet result = stat.executeQuery(queryString); 
	// process query result 
}
```

### Analyzing SQL Exceptions #unfinished 

### Populating a Database
The following steps briefly describe the `ExecSQL` program: 

1. Connect to the database. The `getConnection` method reads the properties in the file `database.properties` and adds the `jdbc.drivers` property to the system properties. The driver manager uses the `jdbc.drivers` property to load the appropriate database driver. The `getConnection` method uses the `jdbc.url`, `jdbc.username`, and` jdbc.password` properties to open the database connection. 
2. Open the file with the SQL statements. If no file name was supplied, prompt the user to enter the statements on the console. 
3. Execute each statement with the generic execute method. If it returns true, the statement had a result set. The four SQL files that we provide for the book database all end in a `SELECT *` statement so that you can see that the data were successfully inserted. 
4. If there was a result set, print out the result. Since this is a generic result set, we need to use metadata to find out how many columns the result has. For more information, see Section 5.8, “Metadata,” on p. 343. 
5. If there is any SQL exception, print the exception and any chained exceptions that may be contained in it. 
6. Close the connection to the database.

- Below code reads a file with SQL statements and executes them so you can populate your database.
- Make sure that your database server is running, and run the program as follows :

>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL Books.sql 
>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL Authors.sql 
>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL Publishers.sql 
>	java -classpath driverPath:. exec.ExecSQL BooksAuthors.sql

- Before running the program, check that the file `database.properties` is set up properly for your environment

# Query Execution
### Prepared Statements
- We can write an SQL query in advance that has some variables , save it and re-use it by just setting the variable to a new value.
- So we can prepare a query with a host variable and use it many times, each time filling in a different string for the variable. 
- That technique improves performance. 
- Whenever the database executes a query, it first computes a strategy of how to do it efficiently. 
- By preparing the query and reusing it, you ensure that the planning step is done only once.
- Each host variable in a prepared query is indicated with a `?`.
- If there is more than one variable, you must keep track of the positions of the `?` when setting the values.
- Before executing the prepared statement, you must bind the host variables to actual values with a `set` method.
- As with the `get` methods of the `ResultSet` interface, there are different `set` methods for the various types.
```java
String publisherQuery = "SELECT Books.Price, Books.Title" 
+ " FROM Books, Publishers" 
+ " WHERE Books.Publisher_Id = Publishers.Publisher_Id AND Publishers.Name = ?"; 

PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement(publisherQuery);
stat.setString(1, publisher);
```
- The first argument is the position number of the host variable that we want to set. 
- The position `1` denotes the first `?`. The second argument is the value that we want to assign to the host variable.
- If you reuse a prepared query that you have already executed, all host variables stay bound unless you change them with a `set` method or call the `clearParameters` method. 
- That means you only need to call a `setXxx` method on those host variables that change from one query to the next.
- Once all variables have been bound to values, you can execute the prepared statement:
```java
ResultSet rs = stat.executeQuery();
```
- A `PreparedStatement` object becomes invalid after the associated `Connection` object is closed. 
- However, many databases automatically cache prepared statements. 
- If the same query is prepared twice, the database simply reuses the query strategy. 
- Therefore, don’t worry about the overhead of calling `prepareStatement`

### Reading and Writing LOBs
- Many databases can store large objects (LOBs) such as images or other data. 
- In SQL, binary large objects are called **BLOBs**, and character large objects are called **CLOBs**
- To read a `LOB`, execute a `SELECT` statement and call the `getBlob` or `getClob` method on the `ResultSet`. You will get an object of type `Blob` or `Clob`. To get the binary data from a `Blob`, call the `getBytes` or `getBinaryStream`.
- Similarly, if you retrieve a `Clob` object, you can get character data by calling the `getSubString` or `getCharacterStream` method.

```java
PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT Cover FROM BookCovers WHERE ISBN=?");
. . .
stat.set(1, isbn);
try (ResultSet result = stat.executeQuery()) 
{ 
	if (result.next()) 
	{ 
		Blob coverBlob = result.getBlob(1); 
		Image coverImage = ImageIO.read(coverBlob.getBinaryStream());
	} 
}
```
- To place a `LOB` into a database, call `createBlob` or `createClob` on your `Connection` object, get an `output stream` or `writer` to the `LOB`, write the data, and store the object in the database.
```java
Blob coverBlob = connection.createBlob(); 
int offset = 0; 

OutputStream out = coverBlob.setBinaryStream(offset);

ImageIO.write(coverImage, "PNG", out); 

PreparedStatement stat = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO Cover VALUES (?, ?)"); 

stat.set(1, isbn); 
stat.set(2, coverBlob); 
stat.executeUpdate();
```

### SQL Escapes #unfinished 
- It is the job of the JDBC driver to translate the escape syntax to the syntax of a particular database.
- Escapes are provided for the following features: 
	- Date and time literals 
	- Calling scalar functions 
	- Calling stored procedures 
	- Outer joins 
	- The escape character in LIKE clauses
### Multiple Results
- It is possible for a query to return multiple results. 
- This can happen when executing a stored procedure, or with databases that also allow submission of multiple SELECT statements in a single query. 
- Here is how you retrieve all result sets:
	1. Use the `execute` method to execute the SQL statement. 
	2. Retrieve the first result or update count. 
	3. Repeatedly call the `getMoreResults` method to move on to the next result set. 
	4. Finish when there are no more result sets or update counts
-
