# Stream API
For a quick reference go to [[9.Stream API Quick Reference]]
- Streams provide a view of data that lets you specify computations at a higher conceptual level than with collections.
- With streams, you provide what you want to do not how to do it.
### From Iterating to Stream Operations

For example count words in a list of strings having length greater than 12 :
```Java
long count = words.stream()
			.filter(w-> w.length() > 12)
			.count();
			 
```
- Simply changing `stream` into `parallelStream` allows the stream library to do the filtering and counting in parallel.
#### Stream vs Collection
1. A stream **does not store** its elements. 
	- They may be stored in an underlying collection or generated on demand.
2. Stream operations don’t mutate their source. 
	- For example, the `filter` method does not remove elements from a new stream, but it yields a new stream in which they are not present.
3. Stream operations are **lazy** when possible. 
	- This means they are not executed until their result is needed. 
	- For example, if you only ask for the first five long words instead of all, the `filter` method will stop filtering after the fifth match. As a consequence, you can even have infinite streams!
#### Working of a Stream
1. Create a stream.
2. Specify intermediate operations for transforming the initial stream into others, possibly in multiple steps.
3. Apply a terminal operation to produce a result. This operation forces the execution of the lazy operations that precede it. Afterwards, the stream can no longer be used.

### Stream Creation
- You can turn any collection into a stream with the `stream()` method of the `Collection` interface.
- If you have an array, use the static `Stream.of `method instead.
```Java
Stream<String> words = Stream.of(contents.split("\\PL+")); 
// split returns a String[] array

Stream<String> song = Stream.of("gently", "down", "the", "stream");
```
- Use` Arrays.stream(array, from, to)` to make a stream from array elements between positions `from` (inclusive) and `to` (exclusive).
```Java
Stream<String> silence = Stream.empty(); 
// Generic type <String> is inferred; same as Stream.<String>empty()
```

- The `Stream` interface has **two static methods** for making *infinite streams*.
- The `generate` method takes a function with no arguments (or, technically, an object of the `Supplier<T>` interface). Whenever a stream value is needed, that function is called to produce a value. 
```Java
//You can get a stream of constant values as :
Stream<String> echos = Stream.generate(() -> "Echo");

//or a stream of random numbers as
Stream<Double> randoms = Stream.generate(Math::random);
```
- To produce infinite sequences, use `iterate` method, which takes a seed value and a function (`UnaryOperator<T>`) and repeatedly applies the function to the previous result.
```Java
Stream<BigInteger> integers = Stream.iterate(BigInteger.ZERO, n -> n.add(BigInteger.ONE));
```

#### API

### The filter, map, and flatMap Methods
#### filter
- The argument of filter is a` Predicate<T>`—that is, a function ***from T to boolean***.
```Java
List<String> wordList = . . .; 
Stream<String> longWords = wordList.stream()
				   .filter(w -> w.length() > 12);
```
#### map
- Often, you want to transform the values in a stream in some way. 
- Use the `map` method and pass the function that carries out the transformation.
```Java
Stream<String> lowercaseWords = words.stream().map(String::toLowerCase);

Stream<String> firstLetters = words.stream().map(s -> s.substring(0, 1));
```

#### flatMap
- Now, suppose you have a function that returns not just one value but a stream of values :
```Java
public static Stream<String> letters(String s) 
{ 
	List<String> result = new ArrayList<>(); 
	for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) result.add(s.substring(i, i + 1)); return result.stream(); 
}

//using map
Stream<Stream<String>> result = words.stream().map(w -> letters(w));
// returns [. . .["y","o"], ["a","b","c"], . . .]

//using flatMap
Stream<String> flatResult = words.stream().flatMap(w -> letters(w)) // Calls letters on each word and flattens the results
```

### Extracting Substreams and Concatenating Streams
- The call `stream.limit(n)` returns a new stream that ends after `n` elements (or when the original stream ends, if it is shorter).
```Java
Stream<Double> randoms = Stream.generate(Math::random).limit(100);
```
- The call `stream.skip(n)`discards the first n elements.
- This is handy when splitting text into words since, due to the way the split method works, the first element is an unwanted empty string.
```Java
Stream<String> words = Stream.of(contents.split("\\PL+")).skip(1);
```
- You can concatenate two streams with the static `concat` method of the `Stream` class :
```Java
Stream<String> combined = Stream.concat( letters("Hello"), letters("World")); 
// Yields the stream ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "W", "o", "r", "l", "d"]
```
- Of course the first stream should not be infinite—otherwise the second one will never get a chance.

### Other Stream Transformations
- The `distinct` method returns a stream of unique elements.
```Java
Stream<String> uniqueWords = Stream.of("merrily", "merrily", "merrily", "gently").distinct(); 
// Only one "merrily" is retained
```
- For sorting a stream, there are several variations of the sorted method. One works for streams of `Comparable` elements, and another accepts a `Comparator`.
```Java
Stream<String> longestFirst = words.stream().sorted(Comparator.comparing(String::length).reversed());
```
- The `peek` method yields another stream with the same elements as the original, but a function is invoked every time an element is retrieved.
```Java
Object[] powers = Stream
.iterate(1.0, p -> p * 2) 
.peek(e -> System.out.println("Fetching " + e)) 
.limit(20)
.toArray();
```

### Simple Reductions
- Reductions are terminal operations. 
- They reduce the stream to a non-stream value that can be used in your program.
- `Optional<T> count()` : returns number of elements of a stream.
- `Optional<T> max()/min()`: returns max/min element of a stream.
- `Optional<T> findFirst()`: returns the first value in a nonempty collection, works well with `filter()`
- `Optional<T> findAny()`: yields any element of this stream, or an empty Optional if this stream is empty.
- `boolean anyMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)`
- `boolean allMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)`
- `boolean noneMatch(Predicate<? super T> predicate)` : returns true if any, all, or none of the elements of this stream match the given predicate.

### The Optional Type
- An `Optional<T>` object is a wrapper for either an object of type `T` or no object. 
- In the former case, we say that the value is present. 
- The `Optional<T>` type is intended as a safer alternative for a reference of type `T` that either refers to an object or is `null`.
#### How to work with it
- Use a method that either produces an *alternative* if the value is not present

```Java
// The wrapped string, or "" if none
String result = optionalString.orElse(""); 

// The function is only called when needed
String result = optionalString.orElseGet(() -> Locale.getDefault().getDisplayName());

// Supply a method that yields an exception object
String result = optionalString.orElseThrow(IllegalStateException::new); 
```
- Or use a method that *consumes* the value only if it is present.
- The `ifPresent` method accepts a function. If the optional value exists, it is passed to that function. Otherwise, nothing happens.
```Java
//optionalValue.ifPresent(v -> Process v);

optionalValue.ifPresent(results::add);
```
- When calling `ifPresent`, no value is returned from the function.
- If you want to process the function result, use `map` instead :
```Java
Optional<Boolean> added = optionalValue.map(results::add);
//Now added has one of three values: true or false wrapped into an Optional, if optionalValue was present, or an empty Optional otherwise.
```
- `optionalValue.get()` -> returns the value of the Optional, or throws a `NoSuchElementException` if empty.
- `optionalValue.isPresent()` -> returns true if optional value is not empty

#### Creating Optional Values
- If you want to write a method that creates an `Optional` object, there are several `static` methods for that purpose.
```Java
public static Optional<Double> inverse(Double x) 
{ 
	return x == 0 ? Optional.empty() : Optional.of(1 / x); 
}
```
- The `ofNullable` method is intended as a bridge from possibly null values to optional values.
- `Optional.ofNullable(obj)` returns `Optional.of(obj)` if obj is not null and `Optional.empty()` otherwise.

### Collecting Results
- You can call the `forEach` method to apply a function to each element, which is a terminating method.
- On a parallel stream, the `forEach` method traverses elements in **arbitrary** order. If you want to process them in stream order, call `forEachOrdered` instead.
- You can call `toArray` and get an array of the stream elements.
- The expression `stream.toArray()` returns an `Object[] array`. If you want an array of the correct type, pass in the array constructor `stream.toArray(String[]:new)`

#### Collector interface and Collectors class
- There is a convenient `collect` method that takes an instance of the `Collector` interface.
- The `Collectors` class provides a large number of factory methods for common collectors.

```Java
//collect stream into a list
List<String> result = stream.collect(Collectors.toList());

//into a set
Set<String> result = stream.collect(Collectors.toSet());

//into a collection
TreeSet<String> result = stream.collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new));

//collect strings in a stream by concatenating them
String result = stream.collect(Collectors.joining(","));

//If your stream contains objects other than strings
String result = stream.map(String::toString).collect(Collectors.joining(","));

//reduce stream results to a sum,avg,max or min use one of summarizing(Int|Long|Double) methods.
IntSummaryStatistics summary = stream.collect( Collectors.summarizingInt(String::length)); 
double averageWordLength = summary.getAverage(); 
double maxWordLength = summary.getMax();
//These methods take a function that maps the stream objects to a number and yield a result of type (Int|Long|Double)SummaryStatistics, simultaneously computing the sum, count, average, minimum, and maximum
```

### Collecting into Maps

- Suppose you have a `Stream<Person>`  called `people` and want to collect the elements into a map so that later you can look up peoples names by their IDs.
```Java
Map<Integer,String> idToName = people.collect(
Collectors.toMap(Person::getId,Person::getName)
);
```
- When you want the value to be the same as the actual object :
```Java
Map<Integer,String> idToName = people.collect(
Collectors.toMap(Person::getId,Function.identity())
);
```
- If there is more than one element with the same key, there is a conflict, and the collector will throw an `IllegalStateException`. To avoid that :
```Java
//For each country find all languages in that country 
Map<String,Set<String>> countryLanguages = locales.collect(
Collectors.toMap(Locale::getCountry(),
				localeObj -> Collections.singleton(localeObj.getLang()),
				(oldVal,newVal) -> {
					//oldVal is a set, newVal is a String
					Set<String> union = new HashSet<>(oldVal);
					//union oldVal with newVal
					union.addAll(newVal);
					return union;
				})
);

//If you want a TreeMap
Map<String,Set<String>> countryLanguages = locales.collect(
Collectors.toMap(Locale::getCountry,
				localeObj -> Collections.singleton(localeObj.getLang()),//generate a singleton set for each map value
				(oldVal,newVal) -> {
					//oldVal,newVal are sets
					Set<String> union = new HashSet<>(oldVal);
					//union oldVal with newVal
					union.addAll(newVal);
					return union;
				},
				TreeMap::new)
);
```

- For each of the `toMap` methods, there is an equivalent `toConcurrentMap` method that yields a concurrent map. 
- A single concurrent map is used in the parallel collection process. When used with a parallel stream, a shared map is more efficient than merging maps. Note that elements are no longer collected in stream order, but that doesn’t usually make a difference.
### Grouping and Partitioning
- Above example using `groupingBy`:
```Java
Map<String,List<Locale>>countryToLocales = locales.collect(
Collectors.groupingBy(Locale::getCountry)
);
```
- When you need to partition your data into two sets use `partitioningBy`:
```Java
Map<Boolean,List<Locale>>englishAndOtherLocales = locales.collect(
Collectors
.partitioningBy(localeObj -> localeObj.getLanguage().equals("en"))
);
```

### Downstream Collectors
- The `groupingBy` method yields a map whose **values are lists**. If you want to process those lists in some way, supply a **downstream collector**.
```Java
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.*

//if you want sets instead of lists
Map<String,List<Locale>>countryToLocales = locales.collect(
groupingBy(Locale::getCountry,toSet())
);

//for reducing grouped elements to numbers:
Map<String,List<Locale>>countryToLocales = locales.collect(
groupingBy(Locale::getCountry,counting())
);
```
- `summing(Int|Long|Double)` takes a function argument, applies the function to the downstream elements, and produces their sum. For example :
```Java
//computes the sum of populations per state in a stream of cities.
Map<String,Integer> stateToCityPopulation = cities.collect( groupingBy(City::getState, summingInt(City::getPopulation)));
```
- `maxBy` and `minBy` take a comparator and produce maximum and minimum of the downstream elements.
```Java
//produces the largest city per state.
Map<String,Optional<City>> stateToLargestCity = cities.collect( groupingBy(City::getState, maxBy(Comparator.comparing(City::getPopulation))));
```
- The `mapping` method yields a collector that applies a function to downstream results and passes the function values to yet another collector.
```Java
Map<String,Optional<String>> stateToLongestCityName = cities.collect( groupingBy(City::getState, mapping(City::getName, maxBy(Comparator.comparing(String::length)))));

//Here, we group cities by state. Within each state, we produce the names of the cities and get the city having maximum length.


//gathering a set of all languages in a country.
Map<String,Set<String>> countryToLanguages = locales.collect( groupingBy(Locale::getDisplayCountry, mapping(Locale::getDisplayLanguage, toSet())));

//If the grouping or mapping function has return type int, long, or double, you can collect elements into a summary statistics object,

Map<String, IntSummaryStatistics> stateToCityPopulationSummary = cities.collect( groupingBy(City::getState, summarizingInt(City::getPopulation)));
```

### Reduction Operations
- The `reduce` method is a general mechanism for computing a value from a stream.
- The simplest form takes a **binary function** and keeps applying it, starting with the first two elements.
```Java
// get the sum of elements in list
Optional<Integer>sum = list.stream().reduce((x,y) -> x+y);
// or
Optional<Integer>sum = list.stream().reduce(Integer::sum);
// or use identity value which will be used as initial value in reduce method and will get returned if the list is empty
Optional<Integer>sum = list.stream().reduce(0, (x,y) -> x+y);
```
- Now suppose you have a stream of objects and want to form the sum of some property, such as all lengths in a stream of strings. 
- You can’t use the simple form of reduce. 
- It requires a function (T, T) -> T, with the same types for the arguments and the result. 
- But in this situation, you have two types: The stream elements have type String, and the accumulated result is an integer. 
- There is a form of reduce that can deal with this situation. 
- First, you supply an “accumulator” function `(total, word) -> total + word.length()`. 
- That function is called repeatedly, forming the cumulative total. 
- But when the computation is parallelized, there will be multiple computations of this kind, and you need to combine their results. You supply a second function for that purpose. The complete call is :
```Java
int result = words.reduce(0, 
(total, word) -> total + word.length(), 
(total1, total2) -> total1 + total2));
```

### Primitive Type Streams
- It is inefficient to wrap the primitives into their wrapper classes and create a stream of those.
- The stream library has specialized types `IntStream`, `LongStream`, and `DoubleStream` that store primitive values directly, without using wrappers. If you want to store `short`, `char`, `byte`, and `boolean`, use an `IntStream`, and for `float`, use a `DoubleStream`.
- To create an `IntStream`, call the `IntStream.of/range` and `Arrays.stream` methods :
```Java
IntStream stream = IntStream.of(1, 1, 2, 3, 5); 

stream = Arrays.stream(values, from, to); // values is an int[] array

IntStream zeroToNinetyNine = IntStream.range(0, 100); // Upper bound is excluded 

IntStream zeroToHundred = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, 100); // Upper bound is included
```
- You can also use the static `generate` and `iterate` methods.
- When you have a stream of objects, you can transform it to a primitive type stream with the `mapToInt`, `mapToLong`, or `mapToDouble` methods.
```Java
IntStream lengths = words.mapToInt(String::length);
```
- To convert a primitive type stream to an object stream, use the `boxed` method :
```Java
Stream<String> integers = IntStream.range(0, 100).boxed();
```
#### Primitive streams vs Object streams
- The `toArray` methods return primitive type arrays. 
- Methods that yield an optional result return an `OptionalInt`, `OptionalLong`, or `OptionalDouble`. These classes are analogous to the Optional class but have methods `getAsInt`, `getAsLong`, and `getAsDouble` instead of the `get` method.
- There are methods `sum`, `average`, `max`, and `min` that return the sum, average, maximum, and minimum. These methods are not defined for object streams.
- The `summaryStatistics` method yields an object of type `IntSummaryStatistics`, `LongSummaryStatistics`, or `DoubleSummaryStatistics` that can simultaneously report the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the stream.

### Parallel Streams
- Streams make it easy to parallelize bulk operations.
- You can get a parallel stream from any collection with the `Collection.parallelStream()` method :
```Java
Stream<String>parallelWords = words.parallelStream();
```
- The `parallel` method converts any sequential stream into a parallel one.
```Java
Stream<String>parallelWords = Stream.of(wordArray).parallel();
```
- As long as the stream is in parallel mode when the terminal method executes, all intermediate stream operations will be parallelized
- When stream operations run in parallel, the intent is that the same result is returned as if they had run serially. 
- It is important that the operations can be executed in an arbitrary order.
#### Bad Code Example
```Java
int[] shortWords = new int[12]; 
words.parallelStream().forEach( s -> { if (s.length() < 12) shortWords[s.length()]++; }); 
// Error–race condition! System.out.println(Arrays.toString(shortWords));
```
- The function passed to `forEach` runs concurrently in multiple threads, each updating a shared array, that’s a classic race condition. If you run this program multiple times, you are quite likely to get a different sequence of counts in each run—each of them wrong.
- It is your responsibility to ensure that any functions you pass to parallel stream operations are safe to execute in parallel.
- The best way to do that is to stay away from mutable state.
- In this example, you can safely parallelize the computation if you group strings by length and count them.
```Java
Map<String,Long> shortWordCounts = words.parallelStream()
.filter(s -> s.length() < 10)
.collect(groupingBy( String::length, counting()));
```
#### When to use Parallel Streams
- By calling the `unordered` method on a stream, you indicate that you are not interested in ordering.
	- One operation that can benefit from this is `Stream.distinct`. On an ordered stream, `distinct` retains the first of all equal elements. That impedes parallelization—the thread processing a segment can’t know which elements to discard until the preceding segment has been processed. If it is acceptable to retain any of the unique elements, all segments can be processed concurrently (using a shared set to track duplicates).
	- You can also speed up the limit method by dropping ordering.
	- If you just want any n elements from a stream and you don’t care which ones you get, call `words.parallelStream().unordered().limit(n);`.
- Merging maps is expensive. For that reason, the `Collectors.groupingByConcurrent` method uses a **shared concurrent map**. To benefit from parallelism, the order of the map values will not be the same as the stream order.
```Java
Map<Integer,List<String>> result = words.parallelStream().collect( Collectors.groupingByConcurrent(String::length));
// Values aren't collected in stream order
```
- Of course, you won’t care if you use a downstream collector that is independent of the ordering, such as :
```Java
Map<Integer,Long> wordCounts = words.parallelStream() .collect( groupingByConcurrent( String::length, counting()));
```
- For parallel streams to work well, a number of conditions need to be fulfilled:
	- The data should be in memory. It would be inefficient to have to wait for the data to arrive.
	- The stream should be efficiently splitable into subregions. A stream backed by an array or a balanced binary tree works well, but the result of `Stream.iterate` does not.
	- The stream operations should do a substantial amount of work. If the total work load is not large, it does not make sense to pay for the cost of setting up the parallel computation.
	- • The stream operations should not block.
