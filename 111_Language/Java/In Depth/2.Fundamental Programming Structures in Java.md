# A Simple Java Program
```Java
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println('Hello world'); // System.out is an object
	}
}
```
- The keyword `public` is an access specifier which controls the level of access other parts of a program have to this code.
- The Key word `class` reminds you that everything in Java program must be inside a class.
- The rules for class names:
	- Names must begin with an uppercase letter and after that, they can have any combination of letters and digits.
	- The length is unlimited.
	- You can't use Java keywords for a class name.
- Make the file name same as the name of the public class.
- JVM always starts execution with the code in the `main` method, which must always be a `public` method.
- If `main` method exits normally , the java program has the exit code 0, to terminate the program use `System.exit` method. 
# Comments
- You can use `//` or `/* */` or `/** */` for writing a comment.
- `/* */` comments do not nest in java.

# Data Types
- Java is a strongly typed language, this means every variable must have a declared type.
- There are 8 primitive types in java :
	1. byte
	2. short
	3. int
	4. long
	5. float
	6. double
	7. boolean
	8. char
#### Integer types
| Type  | Size    |
| ----- | ------- |
| int   | 4 bytes |
| short | 2 bytes |
| byte  | 1 byte  |
| long  | 8 bytes        |

- Long integer numbers have a suffix L or l (for example, 4000000000L).
- Hexadecimal numbers have a prefix 0x or 0X (for example, 0xCAFE).
- Octal numbers have a prefix 0 (for example, 010 is 8).
- you can write numbers in binary, with a prefix 0b or 0B. For example, 0b1001 is 9.
- you can add underscores to number literals, such as 1_000_000.
- Note that Java does not have any unsigned versions of the int, long, short,or byte types.
	- If you work with integer values that can never be negative and you really need an additional bit, you can, with some care, interpret signed integer values as unsigned. For example, instead of having a byte value b represent the range from –128 to 127, you may want a range from 0 to 255. You can store it in a byte. Due to the nature of binary arithmetic, addition, subtraction, and multiplication will work provided they don’t overflow. For other operations, call `Byte.toUnsignedInt(b)` to get an int value between 0 and 255, then process the integer value and cast back to byte. The Integer and Long classes have methods for unsigned division and remainder.
#### Floating-point Types
| Type   | Size    |
| ------ | ------- |
| float  | 4 bytes |
| double | 8 bytes        |


- Numbers of type float have a suffix F or f (for example, 3.14F).
- Floating-point numbers without an F suffix (such as 3.14) are always of type double. You can optionally supply the D or d suffix (for example, 3.14D).
- In hexadecimal notation, you use a p, not an e, to denote the exponent. (An e is a hexadecimal digit.)
- There are three special floating-point values to denote overflows and errors:
	- +ve infinity
	- -ve infinity
	- Nan
- For example, the result of dividing a positive number by 0 is positive infinity. Computing 0/0 or the square root of a negative number yields NaN.
##### Note:
The constants `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, and `Double.NaN` (as well as corresponding Float constants) represent these special values, but they are rarely used in practice. In particular, you cannot test:
```Java
if (x == Double.NaN) //is never true
```
to check whether a particular result equals `Double.NaN`. All “not a number” values are considered distinct. However, you can use the` Double.isNaN` method:
```Java
if (Double.isNaN(x)) // check whether x is "not a number"
```
#### The Char Type
- Literal values of type char are enclosed in single quotes. For example, 'A' is a character constant with value 65. It is different from "A", a string containing a single character.
- Values of type char can be expressed as hexadecimal values that run from `\u0000` to `\uFFFF`.
- The \u escape sequence (but none of the other escape sequences) can even be used outside quoted character constants and strings. For example,
```Java
public static void main(String\u005B\u005D args)
```
- is perfectly legal—\u005B and \u005D are the encodings for [ and ].

| Escape seq | Name            | Unicode value |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| \b         | Backspace       | \u0008        |
| \t         | Tab             | \u0009        |
| \n         | Linefeed        | \u000a        |
| \r         | Carriage return | \u000d        |
| \"         | Double quote    | \u0022        |
| \'         | Single quote    | \u0027        |
| \\         | Backslash       | \u005c              |

- Unicode escape sequences are processed before the code is parsed. For example, "\u0022+\u0022" is not a string consisting of a plus sign surrounded by quotation marks (U+0022). Instead, the \u0022 are converted into " before parsing, yielding ""+"", or an empty string.
- Even more insidiously, you must beware of \u inside comments. The comment:
```Java
// \u000A is a newline
```
- yields a syntax error since \u000A is replaced with a newline when the program is read.
- Similarly, a comment:
```Java
// look inside c:\users
```
- yields a syntax error because the \u is not followed by 4 hex digits.
- In Java, the char type describes a code unit in the UTF-16 encoding.

#### Boolean
- You cannot convert between integers and boolean values.
- The `boolean` type has two values, **false** and **true**.
# Variables and Constants
### Variables
- variables are used to store values and constants are variables whose values don’t change.
- A variable name must begin with a letter and must be a sequence of letters or digits.
	- A letter is defined as 'A'–'Z', 'a'–'z', '_', '$', or any Unicode character that denotes a letter in a language. A single underscore _ cannot be used as a variable name.
- Symbols like '+' or '©' cannot be used inside variable names, nor can spaces.
- you do not need to declare the types of local variables if they can be inferred from the initial value. Simply use the keyword `var` instead of the type:
```Java
var vacationDays = 12; // vacationDays is an int 
var greeting = "Hello"; // greeting is a String
```

### Constants
- you use the keyword `final` to denote a constant.
- It is customary to name constants in all **uppercase**.
- you can assign to the final variable once.
- You can set up a class constant with the keywords `static final`.
### Enumerated types
- Sometimes, a variable should only hold a restricted set of values.
```Java
enum Size { SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA_LARGE };
Size s = Size.MEDIUM;
```
- A variable of type Size can hold only one of the values listed in the type declaration, or the special value `null`.

# Operators
**PUMA IS REBL TAC** :
![](Pasted_image_20230803183359.png)
- Java does not have a comma operator.
- Integer division by 0 raises an exception, whereas floating-point division by 0 yields an `infinite` or `NaN` result.

### Conversion between numeric types
![](Pasted_image_20230803183812.png)
The six solid arrows denote conversions without information loss. The three dotted arrows denote conversions that may lose precision.

### Casts
- Conversions in which loss of information is possible are done by means of casts.
For example:
```Java
double x = 9.997
int nx = (int) x;
```
- `Math.round()` rounds the number to nearest integer, return type is `long`.

### Bitwise operators
- `&` and `| `operators are similar to the `&&` and `||` operators, except that they are not evaluated in “short circuit” fashion—that is, both arguments are evaluated before the result is computed.
- a `>>>` operator fills the top bits with zero, unlike `>>` which extends the sign bit into the top bits. There is **no** `<<<` operator.

# Strings
- Java strings are sequences of Unicode characters.
### Substrings

- `substring(L,R)`: returns the substring `[L , R)` of a string.

### Concatenation
- The `+` operator joins two strings in the order received, exactly as they are given.
- When you concatenate a string with a value that is not a string, the latter is converted to a string.
- If you need to put multiple strings together, separated by a **delimiter**, use the **static** `join` method:
```Java
String all = String.join(" / ", "S", "M", "L", "XL"); 
// all is the string "S / M / L / XL"
```
- As of Java 11, there is a repeat method:
```Java
String repeated = "Java".repeat(3); // repeated is "JavaJavaJava"
```
### Strings are immutable
- Think of the various strings as sitting in a common pool. String variables then point to locations in the pool.
- If you copy a string variable, both the original and the copy share the same characters.
- Don’t we have a memory leak? After all, the original string was allocated on the heap. Fortunately, Java does automatic garbage collection. If a block of memory is no longer needed, it will eventually be recycled.

### Testing String Equality
- To test whether two strings are equal, use the `equals` method.
```Java
s.equals(t); //returns true or false
```
- To test whether two strings are identical except for the upper/lowercase letter distinction, use the `equalsIgnoreCase` method.
```Java
"Hello".equalsIgnoreCase("hello");
```
- Do not use the == operator to test whether two strings are equal! It only determines whether or not the strings are stored in the same location.
### Empty and Null strings
- The empty string "" is a string of length 0. You can test whether a string is empty by calling:
```Java
if(str.length()==0)
//or
if(str.equals(""))
```
- A String variable can also hold a special value, called `null`, that indicates that no object is currently associated with the variable.
### The Strings API
![](Pasted_image_20230803200037.png)
### Building Strings
- Occasionally, you need to build up strings from shorter strings, such as keystrokes or words from a file. It would be inefficient to use string concatenation for this purpose.
- Using the `StringBuilder` class avoids this problem.
- Each time you need to add another part, call the `append` method.
```Java
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
builder.append(ch); // appends a single character 
builder.append(str); // appends a string
```
- When you are done building the string, call the `toString` method.
```Java
String completedString = builder.toString();
```
- The `StringBuilder` class was introduced in Java 5. Its predecessor, `StringBuffer`, is slightly less efficient, but it allows **multiple threads to add or remove characters.** If all string editing happens in a **single thread** (which is usually the case), you should use `StringBuilder` instead.

# Input and Output
### Reading Input

- you first construct a `Scanner` that is attached to `System.in`:
```Java
import java.util.*;
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
```

- Now you can use the various methods of the `Scanner` class to read input. For example, the `nextLine` method reads a line of input.
```Java
System.out.print("What is your name? "); 
String name = in.nextLine();
```

![](Pasted_image_20230803201554.png)

### Formatting output

```Java
double x = 10000.0/3.0;
System.out.printf("%8.2f", x); // 3333.33
//prints x with a field width of 8 characters and a precision of 2 characters.
```
Conversions for `printf`:

Flags for `printf`:
![](Pasted_image_20230803202053.png)
- You can use the static `String.format` method to create a formatted string without printing it:
```Java
String message = String.format("Hello, %s. Next year, you'll be %d", name, age);
```

### File Input and Output
- To read from a file, construct a Scanner object like this:
```Java
Scanner in = new Scanner(Path.of("myfile.txt"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
// If the file name contains backslashes, remember to escape each of them with an additional backslash: "c:\\mydirectory\\myfile.txt".
```
- Now you can read from the file, using any of the `Scanner` methods that we already described.
- To write to a file, construct a `PrintWriter` object.
```Java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter("myfile.txt", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

# Control Flow
### Block Scope
- A block, or compound statement, consists of a number of Java statements, surrounded by a pair of braces.
- Blocks define the scope of your variables.
- A block can be nested inside another block.
```Java
int n;
{
	int k;
} // k is only defined up to here

//But the following is an error
int n;
{
	int k;
	int n; //ERROR--can't redefine n in inner block
}
```
### Switch statement
```Java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); 
System.out.print("Select an option (1, 2, 3, 4) ");
int choice = in.nextInt();
switch (choice)
{
	case 1: 
		. . . 
		break;
	default:
		. . .
		break;
}
```
- A case label can be:
	- A constant expression of type `char`, `byte`, `short`, or `int`
	- An enumerated constant
	- A string literal
- Unlike C++, Java also offers a **labeled break statement** that lets you break out of multiple nested loops.
Syntax:
```Java
label:
{
	if(condition) break label; //exits block
	. . .
}
//jumps here when the break statement executes
```

# Big Numbers
- If the precision of the basic integer and floating-point types is not sufficient, you can turn to a couple of handy classes in the `java.math` package: `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`.
- Use the static `valueOf` method to turn an ordinary number into a big number:
```Java
BigInteger a = BigInteger.valueOf(100);
```
- For longer numbers, use a constructor with a ***string*** parameter:
```Java
BigInteger reallyBig = new BigInteger("22223224462942044552973989346190996");
```

Methods:
![](Pasted_image_20230803221341.png)

# Arrays
- Arrays hold sequence of values of the same type.
### Declaring Arrays
- declaration of an array a of integers:
```Java
int[] a;
// or
int a[];
//or
int[] a = {2,3,4,5,6}; // no need to specify the size
//or 
int[] a = new int[] { 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 } //anonymous array
```
- However, this statement only declares the variable a. It does not yet initialize a with an actual array. Use the `new` operator to create the array:
```Java
int[] a = new int[100];
//or
var a = new int[100];
```
- Once you create an array, you cannot change its length.
- It is legal to have arrays of length 0.
```Java
new int[0]
//or
new int[] {}
// array of length 0 is not the same as null
```
- `arrayName.length()`: for finding the size of the array
- Enhanced for loop:
```Java
/*syntax:

for (variable : collection) statement

*/

for(int element : a)
	. . .
```
- `Arrays.toString(arr)`: returns a string containing the array elements enclosed in square brackets and separated by comma, used for printing print the values of the array.
- `Arrays.sort(arr)`: This method uses a tuned version of **QuickSort Algorithm**.
- `Math.random():` return a floating point number between 0 and 1, by multiplying the result with n, we obtain a random number between 0 and n-1.

### Array Copying
- You can copy one array variable into another, but then both variables refer to the same array:
```Java
int[] luckyNumbers = smallPrimes; 
luckyNumbers[5] = 12; // now smallPrimes[5] is also 12
```
![](Pasted_image_20230803222328.png)
- using `Arrays.copyOf(arr,len_of_new_arr)`: to copy an array
```Java
int[] copiedLuckyNumbers = Arrays.copyOf(luckyNumbers, luckyNumbers.length);
```
- A common use of this method is to increase the size of an array:
```Java
luckyNumbers = Arrays.copyOf(luckyNumbers, 2 * luckyNumbers.length);
```
- The additional elements are filled with 0 if the array contains numbers, false if the array contains boolean values. Conversely, if the length is less than the length of the original array, only the initial values are copied.

### Command Line Parameters
![](Pasted_image_20230803222707.png)
- The name of the program is not stored in the args array.

Array Methods:
![](Pasted_image_20230803223031.png)

### Multidimensional Arrays

```Java
int[][] a = new int[n][m];
// or
int[][] a = {{1,2},{3,4}};

// For of loop
for(double[] row:a)
	for(double value:row)
		. . .
```
- `Arrays.deepToString(arr)`: to convert the array to string
```Java
System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(a));
// [[16, 3, 2, 13], [5, 10, 11, 8], [9, 6, 7, 12], [4, 15, 14, 1]]
```


#### Ragged Arrays
- Java has no multidimensional arrays at all, only one-dimensional arrays. Multidimensional arrays are faked as “arrays of arrays.”

![](Pasted_image_20230803225203.png)

```Java
//dynamic sizing
int[][] a = new int[n][];
for (int i = 0; i<= n; i++) 
	a[i] = new int[m+i];
```
