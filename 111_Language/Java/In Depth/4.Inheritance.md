# Classes, Super classes and Sub classes
### Defining Subclasses
- Use the Java keyword `extends` to denote inheritance.
- All inheritance in Java is public unlike C++.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230805100318.png)
- Subclasses have more functionality than their super classes.
- When designing classes, you place the most general methods in the superclass and more specialized methods in its subclasses.
### Overriding Methods
- When the child class implements a function having the same prototype as that of it's parent's, it is called function overriding .
- The call to the intended function is resolved at runtime, which is called **dynamic binding**.
- An object reference can refer to multiple actual types (parent/child class type), which is called **polymorphism**.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230805102317.png)
- When `e` refers to a `Manager` object, then the `getSalary` method of the Manager class is called.
- But `e` can't access the member variables and methods of `Manager` class as it is an object reference of `Employee` type. 
- `super` is a keyword that directs the compiler to invoke the super class method.
### Subclass Constructor
- In a subclass constructor the call using `super` must be the first statement.
- If the subclass constructor does not call a superclass constructor explicitly, the no-argument constructor of the superclass is invoked.
- If the superclass does not have a no-argument constructor and the subclass constructor does not call another superclass constructor explicitly, the Java compiler reports an error.

### Inheritance Hierarchies
- Java supports Single, multi-level, hierarchical and hybrid inheritance.
- It doesn't support multiple inheritance in classes.

### Polymorphism
- Same name but different functionalities.
- In the Java programming language, object variables are polymorphic.
- For example:
	- ![](Pasted_image_20230806131535.png)
	- A variable of type `Employee` can refer to an object of type `Employee` or to an object of any subclass of the `Employee` class (such as `Manager`, `Executive`, `Secretary`, and so on).
	- But it can only access those members that belongs to the `Employee` class.
- You cannot assign a superclass reference to a subclass variable.

### Understanding Method calls
- If the method is `private`, `static`, `final`, or a `constructor`, then the compiler knows exactly which method to call. This is called **static binding**.
- When you override a method, the subclass method must be at least as visible as the superclass method. 
	- In particular, if the superclass method is `public`, the subclass method must also be declared `public`.

### Preventing Inheritance
- `final` Classes can't be extended.
- No subclass can override a `final` method.
- All methods in a `final` class are automatically `final`, but not the instance fields.
- Use `instanceof` to check before casting from a superclass to a subclass.

- Note:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806132852.png)

### Abstract Classes
- A class with one or more abstract methods must itself be declared abstract.
- If you use the abstract keyword, you do not need to implement the method at all.
- In addition to abstract methods, abstract classes can have fields and concrete methods.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806133448.png)
- When you extend an abstract class, you have two choices. 
	- You can leave some or all of the abstract methods undefined; then you must tag the subclass as abstract as well. 
	- Or you can define all methods, and the subclass is no longer abstract.
- A class can even be declared as abstract though it has no abstract methods.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but you can still create object variables of an abstract class and the compiler ensures that you invoke only methods that are declared in the abstract class using the object variable of the abstract class.

### Access Specifiers
- Here is a summary of the four access control modifiers in Java:
	1. Accessible in the class only (`private`)
	2. Accessible by the world (`public`)
	3. Accessible in the package and all subclasses (`protected`)
	4. Accessible in the package(`default`). No modifiers are needed.
# Object : The Cosmic Superclass
- Every class in Java extends the `Object` class.
- In Java, only the values of primitive types (numbers, characters, and boolean values) are not objects.
- All array types, no matter whether they are arrays of objects or arrays of primitive types, are class types that extend the `Object` class.
### Variable of Type Object
- You can use a variable of type `Object` to refer to objects of any type , to do anything specific with this value you need to apply **cast**.
```Java
Object obj = new Employee("Harry Hacker", 35000);
Employee e = (Employee) obj;
```

### The equals Method:
- It determines whether two object references are identical.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806155745.png)
- The `getClass` method returns the class of an object.
- When you define the `equals` method for a subclass, first call equals on the superclass.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806155904.png)
- `instanceof` returns true for all ancestors of a class.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806160412.png)

### The hashCode Method
- A hash code is an integer that is derived from an object.
- If x and y are two distinct objects, there should be a high probability that `x.hashCode()` and `y.hashCode()` are different.
- The `hashCode` method is defined in the `Object` class. Therefore, every object has a default hash code.
- That hash code is derived from the object’s memory address.
- For strings, the hash codes are derived from their contents.
- If you redefine the `equals` method, you will also need to redefine the `hashCode` method for objects that users might insert into a hash table.
- The `hashCode` method should return an **integer** (which can be **negative**).
- Just combine the hash codes of the instance fields so that the hash codes for different objects are likely to be widely scattered.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806161300.png)
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806161200.png)
- `Objects.hashCode` returns 0 if its argument is `null` and the result of calling `hashCode` on the argument otherwise. Also, use the static `Double.hashCode` method to avoid creating a `Double` object
- If `x.equals(y)` is `true`, then` x.hashCode()` must return the same value as `y.hashCode()`.

### The toString Method
- It returns a string representing the value of this object.
- It follows this format : the name of the class, then the field values enclosed in square brackets.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806174808.png)
- Whenever an object is concatenated with a string by the “+” operator, the Java compiler automatically invokes the `toString` method to obtain a string representation of the object.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806175025.png)
# Object Wrappers and Autoboxing

- Sometimes you need to convert a primitive type like int to an object, that's when **wrapper classes** come in handy.
- The wrapper classes have obvious names: `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Character`, and `Boolean`.
	- The first six inherit from the common superclass `Number`.
- The wrapper classes are immutable.
	- So you cannot change a wrapped value after the wrapper has been constructed. 
	- They are also **final**, so you cannot subclass them.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806181031.png)
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806181058.png)
- The `==` operator, applied to wrapper objects, only tests whether the objects have identical memory locations, so call `equals` method when comparing wrapper objects.
- If you mix Integer and Double types in a conditional expression, then the Integer value is unboxed, promoted to double, and boxed into a Double:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806181404.png)

# Methods with a variable number of parameters
- These are sometimes called `varargs` methods.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806184414.png)
- Note:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806184426.png)
- Here `printf` method is a `varargs` method.

# Enumeration Classes
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806190037.png)
- You can add constructors, methods, and fields to an enumerated type. 
- The constructors are only invoked when the enumerated constants are constructed.
- The constructor of an enumeration is always `private`.
- It is a syntax error to declare an enum constructor as `public` or `protected`
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806190207.png)
- You can omit the `private` modifier, in the above example.
- All enumerated types are subclasses of the class `Enum`.
- Methods:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806190554.png)

# Reflection
- It is a library that provides excellent tools to write programs that manipulate java code dynamically.
- A program that can analyze the capabilities of classes is called **reflective**.
- You can use it to:
	- Analyze the capabilities of classes at runtime
	- Inspect objects at runtime—for example, to write a single `toString` method that works for all classes
	- Implement generic array manipulation code
	- Take advantage of `Method` objects that work just like function pointers in languages such as C++
### The Class class
- When the program is running the Java runtime system always maintains a runtime type identification on all objects which keeps track of the class to which each object belong to.
- The class that holds this info is called `Class` which is a generic class.
- The `getClass()` method in the `Object` class returns an instance of `Class` type.
- A `Class` object describes the properties of a particular class.
- You can obtain a instance of `Class` in 3 ways:
	- ![](Pasted_image_20230806200631.png)
	- ![](Pasted_image_20230806200901.png)
	- ![](Pasted_image_20230806200924.png)
- The virtual machine manages a unique `Class` object for each type. Therefore, you can use the `==` operator to compare class objects.
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806201914.png)
- Create an instance of a class using the object of the `Class` like this:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806202146.png)

### Using Reflection to Analyze the Capabilities of Classes
- The three classes `Field`, `Method`, and `Constructor` in the `java.lang.reflect` package describe the fields, methods, and constructors of a class, respectively.
- All three classes have a method called `getName` that returns the name of the item.
- The `Field` class has a method `getType` that returns an object of type `Class`, that describes the field type.
- All three of these classes also have a method called `getModifiers` that returns an **integer**, with various bits turned on and off, that describes the modifiers used, such as `public` and `static`.
- You can then use the static methods in the `Modifier` class in the `java.lang.reflect` package to analyze the integer that `getModifiers` returns. Use methods like `isPublic`, `isPrivate`, or `isFinal` in the `Modifier` class to tell whether a method or constructor was `public`, `private`, or `final`.
- You can also use the `Modifier.toString` method to print the modifiers.
- The `getFields`, `getMethods`, and `getConstructors` methods of the `Class` class return arrays of the `public` fields, methods, and constructors that the class supports. This includes public members of **superclasses**.
- The `getDeclaredFields`, `getDeclaredMethods`, and `getDeclaredConstructors` methods of the `Class` class return arrays consisting of all fields, methods, and constructors that are declared in the class. This includes `public`, `private`, and `protected` members, but ***not members of superclasses***.
- Look at the example below to understand:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806205832.png)
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806205858.png)

### Using Reflection to Analyze Objects at Runtime
- In this section, we will look at the contents of the fields.
- We use `get` method in the `Field` class to achieve this.
- Example:
- ![](Pasted_image_20230806210333.png)
- The call `f.set(obj, value)` sets the field represented by `f` of the object `obj` to the new value.
- If the fields are `private` it will throw `IllegalAccessException`, but we can get rid of it by doing `f.setAccessible(true);`
- The `setAccessible` method is a method of the `AccessibleObject` class, the common ***superclass*** of the `Field`, `Method`, and `Constructor` classes.

# Design Hints for Inheritance
1. Place common operations and fields in the superclass.
2. Don’t use protected fields.
3. Don’t use inheritance unless all inherited methods make sense.
4. Don’t change the expected behavior when you override a method.
5. Use polymorphism, not type information.
	1. ![](Pasted_image_20230806185640.png)
6. Don’t overuse reflection.
	1. The reflection mechanism lets you write programs with amazing generality, by detecting fields and methods at runtime.
	2. Reflection is fragile—with it, the compiler cannot help you find programming errors. Any errors are found at runtime and result in exceptions.
