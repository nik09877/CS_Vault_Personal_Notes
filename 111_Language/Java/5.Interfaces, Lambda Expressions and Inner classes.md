# Interfaces
- Interface is a way of describing what a class should do, without specifying how they should do it.
- A class can implement one or more interfaces.
- To make a class implement an interface, you carry out two steps:
		1. You declare that your class intends to implement the given interface using `implements` keyword.
		2. You supply definitions for all methods in the interface and declare them `public`.
- All methods in an interface are automatically public.
- However, when implementing the interface, you must declare the method as `public`. 
- Otherwise, the compiler assumes that the method has package access (default) for a class. The compiler then complains that you are trying to supply a more restrictive access privilege.

### Comparable Interface
-  For example, the `sort` method of `Arrays` class demands that the objects must implement the `Comparable` interface.
```Java
public interface Comparable<T>
{
	int compareTo(T other);
}
```
- The `compareTo` method returns negative number if the implicit parameter is smaller than the explicit parameter, zero if they are equal and a positive number otherwise.
```Java
class Employee implements Comparable<Employee>
{
	public int compareTo(Employee other)
	{
		return Double.compare(salary,other.salary); 
		// use Integer.compare(x,y) if x and y are integers
	}
}
```

### Properties of Interfaces
- You can never use the `new` operator to instantiate an interface
- However, you can still declare interface variables and it must refer to an object of a class that implements the interface.
- You can use `instanceof` to check whether an object implements an interface.
- Although you can't put instance fields in an interface, you can supply constants in them.

- Methods in an interface are `public` and fields are `public static final` by default.
- Methods can also be `private`, but as these can only be used in the interface, they act as helper methods.
-  You can supply a `default` implementation for any interface method. you must tag such a method with the `default` modifier.
```Java
public interface Comparable<T>
{
	default int compareTo(T other){ return 0; }
}
```
- A `default` method can call other methods.
```Java
public interface Collection
{
	int size(); // an abstract method
	default boolean isEmpty() { return size() == 0; }
}
```
#### Resolving Default Method Conflicts
What happens if the exact same method is defined as a `default` method in one `interface` and then again as a method of a `superclass` or another `interface`?
1. `Superclasses` win. If a `superclass` provides a `concrete method`, `default` methods with the same name and parameter types are simply ignored.
2. `Interfaces` clash. If an `interface` provides a `default` method, and another interface contains a method with the same name and parameter types (**default or not**), then you must resolve the conflict by overriding that method.
##### Example
```Java
interface person
{
	default String getName() { return "";}
}
interface Named
{
	default String getName() { 
		return getClass().getName();
	}
}
```
What happens if you form a class that implements both of them?
- The Class inherits two inconsistent `getName` methods and instead of choosing one over the other, the Java compiler reports an error and leaves it up to the programmer to resolve the ambiguity.
```Java
Class Student implements Person,Named
{
	public String getName() { 
		return Person.super.getName();
	}
}
```
- Even if the `getName()` method in `Named` class was not declared `default`, the `Student` class wouldn't have inherited the `default` method of `Person` interface. 
- The compiler would have reported an error if an implementation had not been provided for that method.
### Interfaces vs Abstract Classes
- The major difference is that interfaces support multiple inheritance.
- Abstract classes can have instance fields and concrete methods where as interfaces can't.

### Interfaces and Callbacks (Unfinished)
- In callback pattern you specify an action that should occur whenever a particular event occurs.
