# Interfaces
- Interface is a way of describing what a class should do, without specifying how they should do it.
- A class can implement one or more interfaces.
- To make a class implement an interface, you carry out two steps:
		1. You declare that your class intends to implement the given interface using `implements` keyword.
		2. You supply definitions for all methods in the interface and declare them `public`.
- All methods in an interface are automatically public.
- However, when implementing the interface, you must declare the method as `public`. 
- Otherwise, the compiler assumes that the method has package access (default) for a class. The compiler then complains that you are trying to supply a more restrictive access privilege.

### Comparable Interface
-  For example, the `sort` method of `Arrays` class demands that the objects must implement the `Comparable` interface.
```Java
public interface Comparable<T>
{
	int compareTo(T other);
}
```
- The `compareTo` method returns negative number if the implicit parameter is smaller than the explicit parameter, zero if they are equal and a positive number otherwise.
```Java
class Employee implements Comparable<Employee>
{
	public int compareTo(Employee other)
	{
		return Double.compare(salary,other.salary); 
		// use Integer.compare(x,y) if x and y are integers
	}
}
```

### Properties of Interfaces
- You can never use the `new` operator to instantiate an interface
- However, you can still declare interface variables and it must refer to an object of a class that implements the interface.
- You can use `instanceof` to check whether an object implements an interface.
- Although you can't put instance fields in an interface, you can supply constants in them.

- Methods in an interface are `public` and fields are `public static final` by default.
