# History of Java
- Java goes back to 1991, when a group of Sun engineers, led by Patrick Naughton and James Gosling (a Sun Fellow and an all-around computer wizard), wanted to design a small computer language that could be used for consumer devices like cable TV switchboxes. 
- Since these devices do not have a lot of power or memory, the language had to be small and generate very tight code. Also, as different manufacturers may choose different central processing units (CPUs).
- It was important that the language not be tied to any single architecture. The project was code-named “Green.
- ”The requirements for small, tight, and platform-neutral code led the team to design a portable language that generated intermediate code for a virtual machine.
# Features of Java

### 1. Simple

- The syntax for Java is, indeed, a cleaned-up version of C++ syntax. 
- There is no need for header files, pointer arithmetic (or even a pointer syntax), structures, unions, operator overloading, virtual base classes, and so on.
###  2. Object Oriented
- It is a programming paradigm that focuses on the data as objects and on the interfaces to those objects.
### 3. Distributed
- Java has an extensive library of routines for coping with TCP/IP protocols like HTTP and FTP.
- Java applications can open and access objects across the Net via URLs with the same ease as when accessing a local file system.
### 4. Robust
- The Java compiler detects many problems that in other languages would show up only at runtime.
### 5. Secure

- Java browser plug-ins no longer trust remote code unless it is digitally signed and users have agreed to its execution

### 6. Architecture-Neutral
- The compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format.
- The compiled code is executable on many processors, given the presence of the Java runtime system(JVM).
- The Java compiler does this by generating bytecode instructions which have nothing to do with a particular computer architecture.
- Of course, interpreting virtual machine instructions is slower than running machine instructions at full speed. However, virtual machines have the option of translating the most frequently executed bytecode sequences into machine code —a process called just-in-time compilation.
### 7. Portable
- Unlike C and C++, there are no “implementation-dependent” aspects of the specification.
- For example, an int in Java is always a 32-bit integer.
### 8. Interpreted
- The Java interpreter can execute Java bytecodes directly on any machine to which the interpreter has been ported.
### 9. High Performance
- The bytecodes can be translated on the fly (at runtime) into machine code for the particular CPU the application is running on.
- A Just-in-time compiler today ca monitor which code is executed frequently and optimize just that code for speed.
### 10. Multithreaded
- The benefits of multithreading are better interactive responsiveness and real-time behavior.
### 11. Dynamic
- In a number of ways, Java is a more dynamic language than C or C++
- It was designed to adapt to an evolving environment.
- Libraries can freely add new methods and instance variables without any effect on their clients.
- In Java, finding out runtime type information is straightforward.

### Java Applets
- Java programs that work on web pages are called applets.
- To use an applet, you only need a Java-enabled web browser, which will execute the bytecodes for you.
- Inserting an applet into a web page works much like embedding an image. The applet becomes a part of the page, and the text flows around the space used for the applet.

# Common Misconceptions about Java
### Java is an extension of HTML
- Java is a programming language; HTML is a way to describe the structure of a web page. They have nothing in common except that there are HTML extensions for placing Java applets on a web page.
### I use XML, so I don’t need Java
- Java is a programming language; XML is a way to describe data. 
- You can process XML data with any programming language, but the Java API contains process XML data with any programming language, but the Java API contains excellent support for XML processing. 
- In addition, many important XML tools are implemented in Java.
### Java is interpreted, so it is too slow for serious applications
- In the early days of Java, the language was interpreted. 
- Nowadays, the Java virtual machine uses a just-in-time compiler. 
- The “hot spots” of your code will run just as fast in Java as they would in C++ and in some cases even faster.
### JavaScript is a simpler version of Java
- Java is strongly typed—the compiler catches many errors that arise from type misuse. 
- In JavaScript, such errors are only found when the program runs, which makes their elimination far more laborious.

# Java Programming Environment

![[Pasted image 20230802212317.png]]

### JDK:
- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a cross-platformed software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications and applets. 
- It contains:
	- JRE (For running Java programs on your machine)
	- An interpreter/loader (Java)
	- A compiler (Javac)
	- An archiver (jar) and many more
### How to run a program ?
> \> javac program.java
> \> java program

- The javac program is the Java compiler. 
- It compiles the file program.java into the file program.class. 
- The java program launches the Java virtual machine. It executes the bytecodes that the compiler placed in the class file.
