# Threads
- Threads are fundamental units of execution in Java that allow programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently.
- They enable developers to create responsive applications, utilize multi-core processors efficiently and improve overall application performance.

## Process vs Thread
- Process and thread are both fundamental concepts in concurrent computing, but they have distinct characteristics and use cases.
