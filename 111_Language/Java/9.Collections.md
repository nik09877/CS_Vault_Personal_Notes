# The Java Collections Framework

### Separating Collection Interfaces and Implementation
- Take an example of `Queue` interface
	- The interface tells you nothing about how the queue is implemented. Of the two common implementations of a queue, one uses a ***circular array*** and one uses a ***linked list***.
- Therefore it makes sense to use the *interface type* to hold the collection reference, in this way you can easily use a different implementation of that interface later if you want to.

### The Collection interface
- The fundamental interface for collection classes in the Java library is the `Collection` interface.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807193208.png]]
- The add method adds an element to the collection and returns true if the collection is changed otherwise returns false.
- The `iterator` method ***returns an object that implements*** the `Iterator` interface.
- You can use the `iterator` object to visit the elements in the collection one by one.
- Note :
	- The Collections class contains a number of utility methods with parameters or return values that are collections. Do not confuse it with the Collection interface.
### Iterators
- The Iterator interface has four methods :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807193608.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807193947.png]]
- The “for each” loop works with any object that implements the `Iterable` interface, an interface with a single `abstract` method:
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807194034.png]]
- If you want to use the `remove` method of the `Iterator` interface, you need to skip over the element to be removed using `next()` method, only then you can call `rmeove` or else you will get `IllegalStateException`.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807194557.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807194614.png]]

### Generic Utility Methods
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807195016.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807195051.png]]
- Of course, it is a bother if every class that implements the `Collection` interface has to supply so many routine methods. To make life easier for implementors, the library supplies a class `AbstractCollection` that leaves the fundamental methods `size` and `iterator` `abstract` but implements the routine methods in terms of them.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807195943.png]]

# Interfaces in the Collections Framework
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807195128.png]]
- The `ListIterator` interface is a `subinterface` of Iterator. It defines a method for adding an element before the iterator position: `void add(E element)`.
- The `SortedSet` and `SortedMap` interfaces expose the comparator object used for sorting, and they define methods to obtain views of subsets of the collections.
- `NavigableSet` and `NavigableMap` contain additional methods for searching and traversal in sorted sets and maps.
- The `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` classes implement these interfaces.

# Concrete Collections
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807195812.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807200317.png]]
### Linked Lists
- Used for Fast insertion and deletion.
- There is no `add` method in the `Iterator` inter-face. Instead, the `Collections` library supplies a sub interface `ListIterator` that contains an `add` method.
- This `add` method adds the new element before the iterator position , it does not return a `boolean` value like the `add` method of the `Collection` interface.
- For example, the following code skips past the first element in the linked list and adds "Juliet" before the second element :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807221723.png]]
- Finally, a `set` method replaces the last element, returned by a call to `next` or `previous`, with a new element.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807221958.png]]
- If an iterator finds that its collection has been modified by another iterator or by a method of the collection itself, it throws a `ConcurrentModificationException`.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807222134.png]]
- You should never use the random access method `get()` to step through a linked list.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807222300.png]]
- The `get` method has one slight optimization: If the index is at least `size() / 2`, the search for the element ***starts at the end of the list***.
- List Interface Methods :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807222624.png]]
- `ListIterator` Methods :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807222700.png]]
- `LinkedList` Class Methods :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807222737.png]]

### Generic Array Lists
- `ArrayList` is a generic class with a type parameter.

#### Declaring Array Lists
```Java
ArrayList<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<Employee>();
//or
var staff = new ArrayList<Employee>();
//or
ArrayList<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<>();

var elements = new ArrayList<>(); // returns ArrayList<Object>
```
- If you call add and the internal array is full, the array list automatically creates a bigger array and copies all the objects from the smaller to the bigger array.
- ![[Pasted image 20230806180249.png]]
- Methods:
- ![[Pasted image 20230806180503.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230806180545.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230806180611.png]]

### Array Lists vs Vectors
- All methods of the `Vector` class are ***synchronized***.
- It is safe to access a `Vector` object from two threads. But if you access a `vector` from only a single thread, your code wastes quite a bit of time with *synchronization*.
- In contrast, the `ArrayList` methods are not synchronized. 
- It is recommended to use an `ArrayList` instead of a `Vector` whenever you don’t need synchronization.

### Hash Sets
- You should only use a `HashSet` if you don’t care about the ordering of the elements in the collection.
- It stores only unique items.
- In Java, hash tables are implemented as arrays of linked lists.
- Each list is called a *bucket*.
- To find the place of an object in the table, compute its `hash code` and reduce it modulo **the total number of buckets**. The resulting number is the index of the bucket that holds the element.
- Of course, sometimes you will hit a bucket that is already filled. This is called a **hash collision**.
- Then, compare the new object with all objects in that bucket to see if it is already present.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807231744.png]]
- As of Java 8, the buckets change **from linked lists into balanced binary trees when they get full.** This improves performance if a hash function was poorly chosen and yields many collisions, or if malicious code tries to flood a hash table with many values that have identical hash codes.
- If you want more control over the performance of the hash table, you can specify the initial bucket count.
	- You should set it to somewhere between 75% and 150% of the expected element count.
	- The standard library uses bucket counts that are powers of 2, with a default of **16**. 
	- Any value you supply for the table size is automatically rounded to the next power of 2.
- If the hash table gets too full, it needs to be ***rehashed***.
	- To rehash the table, a table with more buckets is created, all elements are inserted into the new table, and the original table is discarded.
	- The load factor determines when a hash table is rehashed.
	- For example, if the load factor is 0.75 (which is the default) and the table is more than 75% full, it is automatically rehashed with twice as many buckets. 
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807232710.png]]
- Example :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807232609.png]]

### Tree Sets
- A `Tree set` similar to `Hash Set`, but it is a sorted collection.
- The sorting is accomplished by a tree data structure. (The current implementation uses a red-black tree.
- In order to use a `Tree set`, you must be able to compare the elements.
- The elements must implement the `Comparable` interface, or you must supply a `Comparator` when constructing the set.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807233507.png]]
- Example :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230807233540.png]]

### Queues and Deques
 - Deque interface is implemented by the `ArrayDeque` and `LinkedList` classes.
 - ![[Pasted_image_20230808001216.png]]
### Priority Queues
- By default it is a **min-heap**.
- Just like a `TreeSet`, a `priority queue`can either hold elements of a class that implements the `Comparable` interface or a `Comparator` object you supply in the constructor.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808001507.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808001531.png]]

# Maps
- It stores `[key,value]` pairs.
- All keys must be unique or else it replaces the old value with new value if same key is used again.
- It is part of the `Collection Framework` but not part of the `Collection` interface, because `Map` works with `key/value pairs`, while the `other collections` work with `just values`.
### Basic Map Operations
- Methods :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808002053.png]]
- Example :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808002120.png]]
### Updating Map Entries
- Consider using a map for counting how often a word occurs in a file. When we see a word, we’d like to increment a counter by 1.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808002625.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808002641.png]]
### Map Views
- Map is not a `Collection`, however you can obtain *views* of the map i.e objects that implement the `Collection` interface or one of its sub interfaces.
- There are three views:
	1. set of keys : `Set<K> keySet()`
	2. collection of values : `Collection<V> values()`
	3. set of [key, value] pairs of the map : `Set<Map.Entry<k,V>> entrySet()`
		- The elements of the `entrySet` are objects of a class implementing the `Map.Entry` interface.
- For example, you can enumerate all keys of a map :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808003501.png]]
- If you invoke the `remove` method of the iterator on the `keySet` view, you actually remove the key and its associated value from the map. However, you cannot add an element to the `keySet` view.
- If you want to look at both keys and values :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808003829.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808004017.png]]

### Weak Hash Maps
- The `WeakHashMap` class was designed to solve an interesting problem.
- What happens with a value whose key is no longer used anywhere in your program?
	- Suppose the last reference to a key has gone away. Then, there is no longer any way to refer to the value object. But, as no part of the program has the key any more, the key/value pair cannot be removed from the map.
- Why can’t the garbage collector remove it? Isn’t it the job of the garbage collector to remove unused objects?
	- The garbage collector traces live objects. As long as the map object is live, all buckets in it are live and won’t be reclaimed.
- You can use a `WeakHashMap` for this.
- This data structure cooperates with the garbage collector to remove key/value pairs when the only reference to the key is the one present in the hash table entry.
#### Inner Working Mechanism
- The `WeakHashMap` uses` weak references` to hold keys.
- A `WeakReference` object holds a reference to another object—in our case, a hash table key.
- Normally, if the garbage collector finds that a particular object has no references to it, it simply reclaims the object. 
- However, if the object is reachable only by a `WeakReference`, the garbage collector still reclaims the object, but places the `weak reference` that led to it into a `queue`. 
- The operations of the `WeakHashMap` periodically check that `queue` for newly arrived `weak references`. 
- The arrival of a `weak reference` in the `queue` signifies that the key was no longer used by anyone and has been collected. 
- The `WeakHashMap` then removes the associated entry.

### Linked Hash Sets and Maps
- The `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap` classes remember in which order you inserted items.
- As entries are inserted into the table, they are joined in a doubly linked list.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808005237.png]]
#### Implement LRU Cache
- A linked hash map can alternatively use **access order**, not insertion order, to iterate through the map entries.
- Every time you call get or put, the affected entry is removed from its current position and placed at the end of the linked list of entries.
- Only the position in the linked list of entries is affected, not the hash table bucket.
- To construct such a hash map, call :
- ![[Pasted image 20230808005659.png]]

### Enumeration Sets and Maps
- The `EnumSet` is an efficient set implementation with elements that belong to an enumerated type.
- The `EnumSet` is internally implemented simply as a sequence of bits. A bit is turned on if the corresponding value is present in the set.
- The `EnumSet` class has no public constructors. Use a static factory method to construct the set :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808010122.png]]
- An `EnumMap` is a map with keys that belong to an enumerated type.
- It is simply and efficiently implemented as an array of values.
- You need to specify the key type in the constructor :
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808010206.png]]
### Identity Hash Maps
- The `IdentityHashMap` has a quite specialized purpose. 
- Here, the hash values for the keys should not be computed by the `hashCode` method but by the `System.identityHashCode` method. 
- That’s the method that `Object.hashCode` uses to compute a hash code from the object’s memory address. 
- Also, for comparison of objects, the `IdentityHashMap` uses `==` not `equals`. 
	- In other words, different key objects are considered distinct even if they have equal contents. 
- This class is useful for implementing object traversal algorithms, such as object serialization, in which you want to keep track of which objects have already been traversed.
### API

# Views and Wrappers
- The `keySet` method returns an object of a class that implements the `Set` interface and whose methods manipulate the original map. Such a collection is called a `view`.
### Small Collections
- Java 9 introduces static methods yielding a set or list with given elements and a map with given key/value pairs.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808134937.png]]
- There is a static method `ofEntries` that accepts an arbitrary number of `Map.Entry<K,V>` objects, which you can create with the static `entry` method.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808135144.png]]
- These collection objects are **unmodifiable**. Any attempt to change their contents results in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- If you want a mutable collection, you can pass the unmodifiable collection to the constructor:
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808135225.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808135312.png]]
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808135335.png]]
- Java doesn’t have a `Pair` class, and some programmers use a `Map.Entry` as a poor man’s pair. You can call `Map.entry(first , second)`
### Subranges
- You can form subrange views for a number of collections.
```Java
List group2 = staff.subList(10, 20); // [L,R) -> [Inclusive,Exclusive)
```
- You can apply any operations to the subrange, and they automatically reflect the entire list.
```Java
group2.clear(); // staff reduction
```
- The elements get automatically cleared from the staff list, and group2 becomes empty.
- For sorted sets and maps, you use the sort order, not the element position, to form subranges.
- The `SortedSet` interface declares three methods :
```Java
SortedSet subSet(E from, E to) 
SortedSet headSet(E to) 
SortedSet tailSet(E from)
```
- These return the **subsets of all elements that are larger than or equal to from and strictly smaller than to**.
- For sorted maps, the similar methods:
```Java
SortedMap subMap(K from, K to) 
SortedMap headMap(K to) 
SortedMap tailMap(K from)
```
- These return views into the maps consisting of all entries in which the ***keys*** fall into the specified ranges.
- The `NavigableSet` interface introduced in Java 6 gives more control over these subrange operations. You can specify whether the bounds are included:
```Java
NavigableSet subSet(E from, boolean fromInclusive, E to, boolean toInclusive) NavigableSet headSet(E to, boolean toInclusive) 
NavigableSet tailSet(E from, boolean fromInclusive)
```

### Unmodifiable Views
- You obtain unmodifiable views by eight methods:
```Java
Collections.unmodifiableCollection() 
Collections.unmodifiableList() 
Collections.unmodifiableSet() 
Collections.unmodifiableSortedSet() 
Collections.unmodifiableNavigableSet() 
Collections.unmodifiableMap() 
Collections.unmodifiableSortedMap() 
Collections.unmodifiableNavigableMap()
```
- Each method is defined to work on an interface. 
- For example, `Collections.unmodifiableList` works with an `ArrayList`, a `LinkedList`, or any other class that implements the `List` interface.
- For example, suppose you want to let some part of your code look at, but not touch, the contents of a collection. Here is what you could do :
```Java
var staff = new LinkedList();
. . . 
lookAt(Collections.unmodifiableList(staff));
```
### Synchronized Views
- Instead of implementing thread-safe collection classes, the library designers used the view mechanism to make regular collections thread safe.
- For example, the static `synchronizedMap` method in the `Collections` class can turn any map into a `Map` with synchronized access methods:
```Java
var map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap ());
```
- You can now access the map object from multiple threads. 
- The methods such as `get` and `put` are synchronized—each method call must be finished completely before another thread can call another method.

### Checked Views
- Checked views are intended as debugging support for a problem that can occur with generic types.
- It is actually possible to smuggle elements of the wrong type into a generic collection.
```Java
var strings = new ArrayList();
ArrayList rawList = strings; // warning only, not an error, for compatibility with legacy code
rawList.add(new Date()); // now strings contains a Date object!

//The erroneous add command is not detected at runtime. Instead, a class cast exception will happen later when another part of the code calls get and casts the result to a String.
```
- A checked view can detect this problem. Define a safe list as follows:
```Java
List safeStrings = Collections.checkedList(strings, String.class);
```
- The view’s `add` method checks that the inserted object belongs to the given class and immediately throws a `ClassCastException` if it does not.

# Algorithms
### Generic method to find Max
```Java
static T max(T[] a) 
static T max(ArrayList v) 
static T max(LinkedList l)
```
#### Implementation
```Java
public static <T extends Comparable> T max(Collection c)
{
	if(c.isEmpty()) throw new NoSuchElementException();
	Iterator<T> iter = c.iterator();
	T largest = iter.next();
	while(iter.hasNext())
	{
		T next = iter.next();
		if(largest.compareTo(next) < 0)
			largest = next;
	}
	return largest;
}
```
### Sorting and Shuffling
- `Collections.sort()` implements a stable sort algorithm which guarantees `O(n logn)` time complexity.
	- This method assumes that the list elements implement the `Comparable` interface.
	- Stable sort algorithms do not switch equal elements.
	- For example if you want to sort by Name first and then their Salary , stable sort is useful.
```Java
var staff = new ArrayList<String>();
Collections.sort(staff);
```
- Here is how you can sort a list of employees by salary:
```Java
staff.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary));
```
- If you want to sort a list in descending order:
```Java
staff.sort(Comparator.reverseOrder())
```
- Sort by descending salary:
```Java
staff.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(Employee::getSalary).reversed());
```

- The Collections class has an algorithm `shuffle` that randomly permutes the order of the elements in a list
```Java
var cards = . . .;
Collections.shuffle(cards);
```

### API
![[Pasted_image_20230808160751.png]]

### Binary Search
- Only works on sorted collections which implement the `List` interface.
- If the collection is not sorted by the `compareTo` element of the `Comparable` interface, supply a `comparator` object as well.
- To be worthwhile, binary search requires random access.
- Therefore, the `binarySearch` algorithm reverts to a **linear search** if you give it a **linked list**.
- A **non-negative return value** from the `binarySearch` method denotes **the index of the matching object**.
- If the value is negative, then there is no matching element.
- However, you can use the return value to compute the location where you should insert element into the collection to keep it sorted.
- The insertion location is `-i - 1`.
```Java
if(i < 0)
	c.add(-i - 1, element);
```

### API 
![[Pasted_image_20230808161457.png]]

### Simple Algorithms
```Java
Collections.replaceAll(words, "C++", "Java");
words.removeIf(word -> word.length() <= 3);
words.replaceAll(String::toLOwerCase);
```

### API
![[Pasted_image_20230808162014.png]]

### Bulk Operations
```Java
c1.removeAll(c2); // removes all elements from c1 that are in c2
c1.retailAll(c2); // removes all elements from c1 that are not in c2 and you can use this to find intersection between two sets
c1.addAll(staff.subList(0,10))
```

### Converting between Collections and Arrays
- `List.of` : array is converted to a collection.
```Java
String[] values = . . .;
var staff = new HashSet<String>(List.of(values));
```
- `toArray()` : collection is converted to an array, but the result is an array of objects and you can't use a cast.
```Java
String[] values = (String[]) staff.toArray(); // ERROR
```
- Instead, use a variant of the `toArray` method and give it an array of length 0 of the type that you’d like, then the returned array is then created as the same array type
```Java
String[] values = staff.toArray(new String[0]);
```
- If you like, you can construct the array to have the correct size:
```Java
staff.toArray(new String[staff.size()]);
```
- In this case, no new array is created.

### Writing Your Own Algorithms
- If you write an algorithm or any method that has a collection as a parameter, you should work with **interfaces**, not concrete implementations.
```Java
public void processItems(Collection<Item> items)
{
	for(Item item : items)
		do something
}
```
- Now anyone can call this method with an `ArrayList` or a `LinkedList` or even an array wrapped with the `List.of` wrapper.  

# Legacy Collections

### The Hashtable Class
- It serves the same purpose as the `HashMap` class but it is `synchronized`.
- If you need concurrent access use `ConcurrentHashMap` else `HashMap`

### Enumerations
- The legacy collections use the `Enumeration` interface for traversing sequences of elements.
- The `Enumeration` interface has two methods, `hasMoreElements` and `nextElement`.
- ![[Pasted_image_20230808171111.png]]

### Properties (Property Maps)
- It is a map structure of a special type.
- It has 3 special characteristics:
	- The keys and values are strings.
	- The map can easily be saved to a file and loaded from a file.
	- There is a secondary table for default values.
- The Java platform class that implements a property map is called `Properties`.
- Property maps are useful in specifying configuration options for programs.
